            "At least 18 people, including United Nations staff, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a UN school-turned-shelter in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza on Wednesday, according to the Gaza Civil Defense and hospital officials. At least 44 others were injured, they said. UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief, said on X that six of its employees were killed “when two airstrikes hit a school and its surroundings in Nuseirat,” in what is “the highest death toll among our staff in a single incident.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that the Israeli Air Force had “conducted a precise strike on terrorists” operating inside the school compound. It claimed the school “was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the state of Israel.” Later on Thursday, the IDF said three of the UNRWA employees killed in the strike were members of Hamas, but did not immediately provide evidence to support the allegation. UNRWA said the three people named by the IDF were teachers, and their names were not included in previous lists of UNRWA staffers that Israel claimed were members of Hamas, including a list from July. The IDF said earlier that “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians,” saying the incident was “a further example of the Hamas terrorist organization’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law.” The strike targeted the Al Jaouni UNRWA facility, which has not operated as a school since October. An estimated 12,000 displaced people, including women and children, have been sheltering in the school, said UNRWA. This is the fifth time that the school compound has been targeted since October 7, according to the UN agency and a Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson. Mahmoud Basal, a Gaza Civil Defense spokesman, said search operations were ongoing amid the rubble, with children and women among the injured. The strike drew condemnation from various officials, including the UN chief. “What’s happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in apost on X.“These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now.” His spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, added on Thursday that “the IDF stated that they had targeted a command-and-control center in the compound. This incident must be independently and thoroughly investigated to ensure accountability.” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said UN staff were working and “providing support to families who have sought refuge in the school.” “Since the beginning of this war, at least 220 UNRWA staff have been killed inGaza,” hewrote on X.“The longer impunity prevails, the more international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions will become irrelevant.” Sam Rose, a senior official at UNRWA, told the BBC in an interview on Thursday that the school had been used as a polio vaccination center just a week before it was struck. Earlier this month, the United Nations led a campaign to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children in Gazaagainst polio, amid a resurgence of the disease in the strip since the war began. The head of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also condemned the strike,writing on X: “Indeed, terribly tragic. No words can reflect the true horror and loss of life in Gaza.” “Hospitals, schools and shelters have been repeatedly bombarded, resulting in deaths of civilians and humanitarians,” he added. “The carnage in Gaza must stop. Ceasefire!” A colleague of the UN workers who were killed told CNN that the group had been distributing food aid earlier and had just sat down to eat lunch when Israel bombed the school. The strike hit the school seconds after she had left to fetch water for the rest of the team from the next room, she said, asking to remain anonymous because she isn’t authorized to speak to the media. “Suddenly, I heard a big explosion. Everything shook. I ran back to see that they had all vanished… all torn to pieces,” she told CNN on the phone, referring to her colleagues. All six of the UNRWA workers had worked as teachers at the school before the war started and they were well-known members of the local community, she added. “They are all loved by everyone. They helped and provided aid to everyone… What Israel is claiming is an unacceptable lie. No resistance fighters existed or operated from the school,” she said. Footage from the scene showed debris strewn around a compound and blood stains on the ground. A hole punctured what appeared to be a classroom and among the rubble was canned food and the dust-covered belongings of displaced Palestinians. A man carrying human remains said: “Brutality, I don’t know what to say.” Another man searched desperately for his wife and four children. “I don’t know where they are, my son, my three daughters are all missing,” Hani Haniya said from a classroom in the building. “They normally sit here, I don’t know where my wife is, she survived the last strike.” Inside a wrecked room at the school, Fadel Abu Hdayyeh said it was used to store food for displaced Palestinians. “Those who were working here were providing aid. We don’t have any resistance fighters here, none of them enter the school. Look around, it’s all food aid,” he said. “The people who were distributing the aid are the ones who died, civilians. We are all civilians here who are dying,” he added. Hassan Al Hilu, who had been displaced from Gaza City, was working on the school’s sewage pipes when the strike hit the building. He was thrown in the air by the blast, injuring one of his hands. “They are all very good people. I know them all. They are all UNRWA workers. They were always working on distributing aid, like rice, coupons, cleaning products to people in the school,” Al Hilu told CNN. “They were eating (when the strike hit).” Rabia Al Burdeini, who lives next to the school, told CNN that some of the victims were “torn to pieces” while others lost their limbs. “Suddenly, without any prior warning.” At Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, footage showed trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. The emergency room floor was overcrowded with the injured while medical teams struggled to provide aid. Nuseirat is one of Gaza’s most densely populated camps, and its population has swelled since the war began. Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, more than 41,000 people have been killed and 95,000 injured in Gaza, according to the latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health. CNN cannot verify casualty numbers. Medical records in the war-torn enclave do not differentiate between civilians and militants killed. Earlier Wednesday, an Israeli bombardment killed one child and six other people in the Qizan Al-Najjar area, near Khan Younis, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense. That followed an overnight strike on a family home in the town of Khuza’a, east of Khan Younis, where at least 11 people were killed, according to the Civil Defense. In a separate attack, at least nine members of the same family were killed in an Israeli strike in Jabalya, northern Gaza, it said. Footage of the aftermath, published by Gaza’s Civil Defense, showed the dismembered limbs of children. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.

            "http status: 200\n",
            "Michel Barnier, the EU’s former chief Brexit negotiator, has become France’s new prime minister, the French president’s office says, ending two months of stalemate following inconclusive parliamentary elections. In a statement on Thursday, the Élysée Palace said: “The President of the Republic has appointed Michel Barnier as Prime Minister. He has to form a united government to serve the country and the French people.” The statement added that Barnier’s appointment comes after “an unprecedented cycle of consultations” in order to ensure a stable government. Barnier, 73, a staunch Europhile, is a member of the Republicans party which represents the traditional right. He is best known on the international stage for his role in mediating the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. A 40-year veteran of French and European politics, Barnier has held various ministerial positions in France, including roles as foreign, agriculture and environment ministers. He served twice as a European commissioner as well as an adviser to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. In 2021, Barnier announced his bid for presidential elections but failed to garner enough support within his party. Macron accepted the resignation of former Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and his government in July, after his centrist Ensemble alliance was defeated in the second round of France’s snap parliamentary election. The president has since faced calls from across the political divide to name a new PM. Last week, Macron told journalists during a trip to Serbia he was “making all the necessary efforts” to finalize a name. “I will have the opportunity in a few days, in just a few weeks, to state the major legislative priorities and proposals on behalf of the new government before parliament. It will be a question of responding, as much as we can, to the challenges, to the anger, as you mentioned, to the suffering, to the feeling of abandonment, of injustice that runs through our cities, our neighborhoods and our countryside far too much,” Barnier said, speaking alongside Attal during the transfer of power at Hotel Matignon, the prime minister’s office in Paris. Surrounded by his family, staff members and several lawmakers, Attal congratulated Barnier. “The French know you. They know that you are a great local elected official,” said Attal, praising Barnier’s “almost unmatched experience of serving the state in various international and European functions.” But he did not hide his frustration that his tenure came to such an abrupt end. “Eight months is too short,” Attal said, warning that the country’s politics is suffering, “but recovery is possible.” Barnier’s prospects for forming a stable government are unclear. Currently, France’s far-right National Rally (RN) is one of the largest parties in parliament following the election in early July. It has previously suggested it could be open to working with Barnier and would not immediately veto him. Still, RN politician Laurent Jacobelli spoke disparagingly of Barnier, telling French television network TF1: “They are taking out of mothballs those who have governed France for 40 years.” The leaders of France’s main far-right and far-left political parties reacted to the appointment of Barnier following Thursday’s announcement, with the far left condemning the decision. Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally party, said on social media that his party will “judge” Barnier based on his inaugural “general policy speech, his budgetary decisions and his actions.” Bardella’s party colleague Marine Le Pen also stressed in televised remarks that the party “will not participate in any government whatsoever” until after they have heard Barnier’s speech laying out his policy plans. Le Pen did go on to commend Barnier on one level, describing the veteran politician as “someone who is respectful of the different political forces” and “capable” of addressing her party. Meanwhile, Jean-Luc Melenchon of the far-left France Unbowed party delivered a stinging rebuke of President Macron, accusing him of “stealing” the parliamentary elections held in July. “The president has just officially denied the results of the legislative elections that he himself had called for. He (Barnier) is a member, among others, of a party which was last in the legislative election. The election was therefore stolen from the French people,” Melenchon remarked in a televised speech. The left-wing leader called on French people to protests against Barnier’s appointment from this Saturday. Barnier served as the chief negotiator during the UK’s exit from the European Union. The lengthy talks between London and Brussels ran from 2016 to 2021 and he is known among Brexiteers in the UK for driving a hard bargain. Born in January 1951 in a suburb of the Alpine city of Grenoble, Barnier was first elected to parliament at the age of 27.\n",

            "Russia has launched acounter-attack in the Kursk border regionwhere Ukrainian forces last month launched a surprise cross-border incursion. “The Russians have started counteroffensive actions,” Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskysaid during a news conference Thursday, his first comments since reports emerged of Russia fighting back in Kursk. Ukraine has been anticipating a Russian reaction and a counteroffensive is in line with the ‘Ukrainian plan,’ Zelensky said. Zelensky has previously said that the surprise attack on Russia’s Kursk region was the initial step in a four-part “victory plan.” The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement Thursday that Russian forces had “penetrated” into the Kursk region, capturing 10 settlements. A social media video geolocated by CNN showed a Russian mechanized assault group in the settlement of Snagost on the western edge of territory controlled by Ukraine. On August 6, Ukrainian forces stormed into the Kursk region in ashock, lightning strikethat caught even American officials by surprise. It marked the first foreign attack on Russian soil since World War Two and saw thousands of troops burst through the border into the region armed with heavy weaponry. It signaled that, despite Russia’s advantage in terms of men and armor, its military has vulnerabilities. The attack left Russia scrambling to shore up its defenses, with US officials telling CNN that Moscow had to divert thousands of troops from occupied territory inside Ukraine to counter the threat. Russian President Vladimir Putin was forced to bring in conscripts, backpeddling on a promise he made not to use them on the frontline. Last week, Zelensky said Ukraine had captured around 100 settlements in the Kursk region, and around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. One aim of the incursion was to divert Russian forces away from the eastern frontline in Ukraine, where they continue to make incremental gains. Another apparent goal was to boost morale in the Ukrainian army after a torrid few months. Experts told CNN that Ukraine’s bold gambit to breach Russia’s border – planned in total secrecy – had stunned even Kyiv’s closest allies and shifted the playing field of a more than two-year war. In a joint public appearance on Sunday, both CIA chief Bill Burns and Head of MI6 Richard Mooreendorsed Ukraine’s invasion of Kursk, with Moore saying that it changed the narrative, and Burns that it was a significant tactical achievement. In a separate development, Russian shelling killed three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) while they were working in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky said. The ICRC said its workers were killed when their vehicles were hit as they prepared to distribute wood and coal briquettes to residents in the region. The organization did not say who was behind the shelling. ”We are shattered,” ICRC Ukraine Spokesman Pat Griffith told CNN. “Three of my colleagues killed, two injured, during an aid distribution in Donetsk region.” The three ICRC staffers who were killed in the artillery shelling were Ukrainian nationals, Ukraine’s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. ICRC teams are regularly present in the Donetsk region and their vehicles are “clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem,” the organization said. The ICRC called for the respect of international humanitarian law, “including by taking every precaution possible to ensure that those engaged in humanitarian activities are not targeted or caught in hostilities.” Zelensky called the shelling on the ICRC team “another Russian war crime.”\n",

            "For decades, life choices were bleak for many in El Salvador: Leave or die. Dubbed the “murder capital of the world,” there was an average of a homicide an hour in early 2016, in this country of just 6 million people — two million fewer than call New York City home. Gang warfare drove an exodus of Salvadorans, mostly north to the US. But now, the security situation is so different that people are returning, even after building good new lives over decades in the US. The transformation is because ofPresident Nayib Bukeleand his increasing grip on power that has allowed him to bring peace to the streets albeit with a cost. Some constitutional rights like due process have been suspended under emergency measures, leading to a massive increase in incarceration, and an outcry from human rights groups. CNN traveled to the country to see and hear what Salvadorans think. When Victor Bolaños and his wife, Blanca, lost their asylum case in a US immigration court, their ‘American dream’ came crashing down. When they agreed to accept a voluntary departure order, the couple knew they had to leave behind the life they had been building for over 15 years in Denver and return to their native El Salvador and the conditions that had made them flee. “We came back 6 years ago, and everything was unsafe,” Victor recalls, seated in the modest home the couple now shares in the capital, San Salvador. At 65, his voice carries the weight of what they faced upon their return in 2018. “When we came back the situation seemed difficult because of the insecurity, lots of robberies, lots of gangs.” But a couple of years after their return, something unexpected happened. The relentless daily violence eased, and streets began to calm. The suffocating fear that had defined daily life started to fade. El Salvador, once synonymous with violence and waves of emigration, saw a dramatic drop in crime. For many citizens, this shift offered more than just safety — it offered much needed hope. The world, too, took notice. Suddenly, the small Central American nation seemed to be reinventing itself under Bukele, who was elected President in 2019 at the age of 37. When his New Ideas party later took control of Congress, it was easier for rules to be bent or broken. Bukele won re-election,even though the country’s constitution had barred anyonestanding for a second term. A “temporary” state of emergency granting authoritarian powers of detention is now more than two years old. Human Rights Watch says that even children are being caught up in“severe human rights violations.” Yet in San Salvador, Blanca sits in her living room, carefully crafting handmade jewelry. “Now, one feels safe, freedom is felt in our country,” she says. She and her husband, Victor, say the improved security has allowed them to start a small jewelry business from their home, something that once seemed impossible. “Now you can have a business, if you look, there are entrepreneurs everywhere in the country,” Blanca says, reflecting on how, not long ago, gang extortion would have crippled any such venture. For decades, people from Central America, particularly from the Northern Triangle of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have fled violence and insecurity, seeking protection and opportunity in the US. But new data from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reveals a surprising trend — fewer Salvadorans are now heading north. In 2022, CBP recorded more than 97,000 encounters with Salvadoran citizens at the Southern Border. By 2023, that number fell to just over 61,000, and 2024 is on track for an additional decline compared to 2023. While these numbers may appear promising, the root causes of migration remain complex.  Many Salvadorans still leave their country due to economic hardship and lack of opportunity. Although El Salvador’s economy has shown slow, steady growth since Bukele took office, according to the World Bank, the nation still struggles to provide sufficient opportunities for its citizens. For the past 27 years, Diego Morales has built a life far from home. The 48-year-old real estate investor, husband, and father of three left El Salvador in 1997, chasing the safety, stability, and opportunity that the US had to offer. The idea of returning had never crossed his mind — until the grim stories of violence that had haunted his homeland for so many years were replaced by tales of newfound safety. Diego’s childhood was marred by a constant sense of danger.  “I’d wake up, go to school and find dead people on the street,” he recalls, his voice bearing the burden of the painful memories as he sits inside his well-kept, suburban Houston home. But today, El Salvador is no longer the country he fled. “Now it’s safe and many people are going back,” Diego says, his words a reflection of the optimism spreading among Salvadorans and others abroad. The country’s reputation has dramatically shifted. Once known for violence, El Salvador is now attracting waves of investors. “Many people, even Americans … we have friends from Florida, from Austin, from Hawaii, looking to buy (property),” he says, a sign of just how far the nation has come. Diego himself is preparing for a return to the land he once left behind. He has already invested in Tamanique, his hometown about an hour’s drive from the capital, where he built a beach resort that he now runs remotely. Along the Salvadoran coastline, you can find beach towns like El Tunco, El Zonte, and La Libertad buzzing with new construction, capturing the attention of tourists and real estate developers eager to capitalize on the country’s rebirth. Cliffs that were once gang lookouts are now being considered scenic locations for hotels. “As soon as President Bukele brought security to this country, everything went up (in value),” Diego says, adding that land that cost around $100,000 five years ago is now going for ten times that price. And the Salvadoran dream is not just his — his 23-year-old son, Jairo, a natural-born US citizen also plans to follow in his father’s footsteps. “We’ve had conversations… it’s already starting,” Jairo says, his eyes lit with the promise of returning to his roots. El Salvador’s government is courting those who left with a program of tax exemptions on belongings and vehicles for citizens who return home. Since 2022, nearly 19,000 Salvadorans have moved back under this initiative, according to government figures. A decade or so ago gangs like MS-13 and Barrio 18 terrorized communities, extorting businesses and waging brutal turf wars over control of neighborhoods, and El Salvador was the most violent nation in the Western Hemisphere, according toInSight Crime. But something extraordinary has happened since then. By 2022, the number of murders began to drop dramatically, and the next year there were 154 homicides — a staggering 97.7% decrease compared to 2015, according to government figures. Bukeleeven tweeted that his country’s homicide rate was the lowestin all the Americas. The sharp decline followed Bukelebringing in emergency measuresgiving police the power to detain suspects without charges for up to 15 days and deploying the military across the nation. The new rules, which are still in effect, allowed an unprecedented crackdown on gang activity, with more than 80,000 people detained since the state of emergency began in March 2022. Central to this effort is the newly constructed “Terrorist Confinement Center,” or Cecot, a massive prison complex with the capacity to hold up to 40,000 inmates. The maximum-security prison currently holds 14,000 gang members — all accused of having murdered at least one person. Images from Cecot show tattooed men with their heads shaved in a warehouse-sized concrete room filled with metal bunks, or sitting in tight rows on the ground, wearing nothing but white shorts, their heads bowed and hands behind their backs. And, according to Salvadoran authorities, those sent to Cecot will never be released. “We have no mercy in crimes related to life,” Security Minister Gustavo Villatoro told CNN. “I think this is the way to face a serial killer. You have to work, you have to prepare your laws, so that when you put them in jail they’ll never be released, because the society does not deserve that,” he said. “Somebody who every day kills people, rapes our girls … How can you change their mind? We are not stupid.” Villatoro’s words echo the brutal reality El Salvador has faced for years. He claims that gang members were required to kill at least one person as part of their initiation into groups like MS-13 or Barrio 18. “Imagine a serial killer in your state, in your community, being released by a judge, how would you feel as a citizen?” he asks. “We don’t have facts that someone can change the mind of a serial killer, and we have more than 40,000 in El Salvador.” The government’s hardline approach was not spontaneous; it was meticulously planned. Villatoro and members of Bukele’s cabinet had begun studying the gangs as early as 2017. “Before you start a war, you have to know your enemy,” he explained. While the government’s relentless campaign has been praised by many for restoring peace, it has also attracted significant criticism. Human rights groups have accused the Bukele administration of widespread abuses in its battle against the gangs. Villatoro, however, dismisses these claims, asserting that the focus should be on the victims, not the criminals. “What about the society, the good citizens that you have in the country … Where were (these human rights groups) when we lost 30 Salvadorans in our country a day?” he asks pointedly. Bukele himself has been unflinching in his rhetoric. In 2022, he famously challenged human rights advocates, telling them to “take” the gang members if they cared so much. “Come pick them up — we’ll give them to you, two for the price of one,” he declared. The president’s iron-fist approach to security has earned him praise from some US conservatives, who have openly applauded Bukele’s tactics. However, at this year’s Republican National Convention, former US President Donald Trump took an unexpected swipe at Bukele when addressing the country’s newfound safety. “In El Salvador, murders are down 70 percent. Why are they down? They’re down because they’re sending their murderers to the United States of America,” Trump claimed, offering no evidence to support his statement. CNN asked Security Minister Villatoro whether Trump’s assertion held any truth. “No,” Villatoro replied. “The problem with that, you (Trump) don’t have facts, you don’t have evidence, but instead, we have evidence of where we put our terrorists,” the minister said, referring to Cecot, the massive prison where thousands of gang members are held For months, CNN has sought access to Cecot, but the Salvadoran government has repeatedly denied our requests to go inside. In other detention centers, lower-ranking gang members and other criminals are tasked with fixing what the gangs broke and erasing their presence. Some inmates are sent to rebuild homes while others smash tombstones commemorating underworld leaders. In early 2024, Juan Carlos Cornejo found himself swept up in Bukele’s mass arrests after an anonymous call to the police accused him of “illicit association.” Hours later, he was in jail, confused and terrified. Juan Carlos believes he was targeted simply because of how he looked. “I was accused of illicit association, but I have nothing to do with that. I like music, rock, so my appearance was different. I had long hair,” he said from his dimly lit, mosquito-ridden home in Santa Ana, a city about 35 miles from the capital. “I have tattoos, but these are artistic expressions,” he said, his frustration palpable. “There was no investigation, nothing,” he claims. Juan Carlos was in prison for five long months. Before his detention, he had been working as a veterinary assistant, treating sick or injured pets, and he insists he had never been arrested before. His release came only after Socorro Jurídico Humanitario (SJH), a group dedicated to providing legal counsel in cases of human rights violations, successfully filed a writ of habeas corpus on his behalf. But Juan Carlos’ story is far from unique. According to SJH, between 33,000 and 35,000 people have been “detained in an arbitrary manner without any justification” since the state of emergency began. “The only argument that was given … is that his arrest was due to an ‘anonymous call’ that had been received, however, no proof was ever shown of this alleged call,” the organization told CNN. Despite widespread criticism of these tactics, the Bukele government stands firm. Officials argue that these measures — though harsh — are done lawfully and are necessary to secure the country’s future. And they highlight efforts to rehabilitate tens of thousands of inmates convicted of lesser crimes. Critics argue that Salvadorans have traded freedom for security, but the people we met say they have never felt so free. There’s the mother laughing as she takes her skipping toddler to the park, not afraid of getting caught in a gun battle or stumbling over a corpse or having to pay the gang extortion “rent” to simply enter her own neighborhood. There’s the father, no longer worried his son will be recruited by gangs. Unlike in places like Cuba or China, where residents can seem nervous to criticize repressive regimes, in El Salvador the optimism appears real. Teresa Lilian Gutierrez is caught in the middle, and her experience shows the many complexities of life in El Salvador today. “Now it’s safe, it’s calm,” she told us on a street in La Campanera, once among the most dangerous neighborhoods in San Salvador. “Before no one would visit, not even family.” But her son who helped her financially is not able to visit, she said. “He’s been detained for two years in Mariona (prison). He is not a gang member, he was taken in the state of emergency,” she said, showing pictures of her son working as a cashier in a restaurant. “I ask the government to get him out, please … I spoke to the lawyer last year because they were going to release him, but she said no, they’re not going to give him to me,” she said. President Bukele enjoys one of the highest approval ratings in Latin America, a sentiment echoed by the people we meet while with the Salvadoran army touring a once gang-infested area outside San Salvador. Armored cars and uniformed soldiers are no longer terrifying reasons to run but chances for curious children to ask questions or for supporters to grab a selfie. “It was so bad before, you couldn’t go anywhere,” one woman says, beaming as she snaps a picture with Defense Minister René Merino, who has become a symbol of the government’s hardline security strategy. A few years ago, no one in this area would have looked members of the police or army in the eye, Merino said, but now it’s all changed. Moments later, another resident steps forward, and thanks the minister and poses for a photo, apologizing for interrupting our interview.  In what feels more like a victory parade  than a law enforcement patrol, we stop dozens of times over the course of a couple hours as residents excitedly relay their gratitude. “Only (God) knows how we were doing before,” one woman told CNN, her voice trembling as her eyes filled with tears. Her emotions reveal the deep scars left by the violence that once consumed their daily lives — and the relief that has followed. But the looming question is: what happens after 2029, when Bukele’s term comes to an end? In a recent interview, the president declared he would not seek a third term, leaving many to wonder about the future. For some, like Blanca Bolaños, the answer is already clear. “I voted for Nayib this time, and the last, and if he runs again, I will vote for him,” she says with unwavering conviction. As the country grapples with its transformation, Bukele’s legacy and controversial tactics will be tested. Whether El Salvador’s newfound stability endures or falters, only time will tell. But for now, among those who say their lives have been changed, there is little doubt: they believe in Bukele, and they would follow him again.\n",

            "New pictures of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un touring what state media said is a uranium enrichment facility have given an extremely rare glimpse inside the isolated nation’s closely guarded nuclear weapons program. According to a report from Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Friday, Kim visited the facility - a bright, sterile warehouse filled with long rows of cylindrical machinery - which is used to produce weapons-grade nuclear material for the North’s growing arsenal. The report comes as North Korea continues to ramp up its illegal nuclear weapons program and strengthens relations with Russia, deepening widespread concern in the West over the isolated nation’s direction under Kim. The location and exact date of Kim’s visit to the site were not disclosed in the report, but the purpose of his inspection was clear, according to KCNA: to lay out a “long-term plan for increasing the production of weapon-grade nuclear materials.” Experts say the images – which show Kim flanked by men in military uniforms and crisp white lab shirts – underscore North Korea’s growing confidence in its position as a nuclear power. “Kim is exceptionally confident these days and he’s particularly interested in making sure that his calls for a massive increase in nuclear capabilities are not misinterpreted,” said Ankit Panda,  Stanton Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, adding “these disclosures lend credibility to North Korea’s plans and demonstrate that they’ve come a long way in their enrichment capabilities.” It’s a theme the North Korean leader has touched on frequently in recent years, including this week. In a speech celebrating the 76th anniversary of North Korea’s founding on Monday, Kim pledged to “exponentially” expand the regime’s nuclear arsenal, reiterating bellicose rhetoric he has used in the past. During his visit to the purported enrichment facility, Kim expressed repeated satisfaction with the technical capabilities of North Korea’s nuclear sector and emphasized the need to increase the number of centrifuges for greater production, according to state media. Park Won-gon, professor of North Korean Studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the timing of the disclosure is also important. “By showing highly enriched uranium and production facilities, they are sending a message that the world must recognize North Korea as a nuclear state. By disclosing these facilities, Kim Jong Un is saying that denuclearization of North Korea is unrealistic,” he told CNN. That stance is unlikely to be accepted by the US and its allies in the region. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, former US national security adviser Robert O’Brien said America and its partners should continue to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The former Trump Administration official added it would be difficult for the US to accept North Korea as a nuclear power even if Pyongyang were to stop building new nuclear weapons. Such an agreement, he argued, could contribute to wider nuclear proliferation. “To excuse the North Koreans and say, ‘It’s okay for North Korea to have a bomb,’ it’s pretty hard then to say, ‘Well, no, Iran can’t have a bomb, and Saudi Arabia can’t have a bomb to deter Iran,’” O’Brien said. “It can’t just be that the bad guys can get the bomb with impunity.” The carefully released pictures of the uranium enrichment facility comes at a time of heightened tensions between North Korea and the West, with the US and its allies accusing North Korea ofproviding substantial military aidto Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied North Korean arms exports, despite significant evidence of such transfers. In June, the two autocratic nations pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked, according to alandmark defense pactagreed to during a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Pyongyang. Since the location of this facility was not revealed in the KCNA report, it’s unclear whether the images are from a site already known to international observers, such as the Yongbyon nuclear research facility, or something entirely new. North Korea is believed to have several sites for enriching uranium. “I’m not sure we can establish the site from the images,” said Martyn Williams, a Senior Fellow at the Stimson Center, “but it’s certainly the first time we’ve seen this set up and in this level of detail.”\n",

            "Ukraine struck the Moscow region on Tuesday in its biggest drone attack so far on the Russian capital, killing at least one woman, wrecking dozens of homes and forcing around 50 flights to be diverted from airports around Moscow. Russia, the world’s biggest nuclear power, said it destroyed at least 20 Ukrainian attack drones as they swarmed over the Moscow region, which has a population of more than 21 million, and 124 more over eight other regions. At least one person was killed near Moscow, Russian authorities said. Three of Moscow’s four airports were closed for more than six hours and almost 50 flights were diverted. Kyiv said Russia, which sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, had attacked it overnight with 46 drones, of which 38 were destroyed. The drone attacks on Russia damaged at high-rise apartment buildings in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region, setting flats on fire, residents told Reuters. A 46-year-old woman was killed and three people were wounded in Ramenskoye, Moscow regional governor Andrei Vorobyov said. Residents said they awoke to blasts and fire. “I looked at the window and saw a ball of fire,” Alexander Li, a resident of the district told Reuters. “The window got blown out by the shockwave.” Georgy, a resident who declined to give his surname, said he heard a drone buzzing outside his building in the early hours. “I drew back the curtain and it hit the building right before my eyes, I saw it all,” he said. “I took my family and we ran outside.” The Ramenskoye district, some 50 km (31 miles) southeast of the Kremlin, has a population of around quarter a million of people, according to official data. More than 70 drones were also downed over Russia’s Bryansk region and tens more over other regions, Russia’s defense ministry said. There was no damage or casualties reported there. As Russia advances in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv has taken the war to Russia with a cross-border attack in Russia’s western Kursk region that began on Aug. 6 and by carrying out increasingly large drone attacks deep into Russian territory. The war has largely been a grinding artillery and drone war along the 1,000 km (620 mile) heavily fortified front line in southern and eastern Ukraine involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems. Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production and assembly to attack targets including tanks, energy infrastructure such as refineries and airfields. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigors of the war, says the Ukrainian drone attacks are “terrorism” as they target civilian infrastructure - and has vowed a response. Moscow and other big Russian cities have largely been insulated from the war. Russia has hit Ukraine with thousands of missiles and drones in the last two-and-a-half years, killing thousands of civilians, wrecking much of the country’s energy system and damaging commercial and residential properties across the country. Ukraine says it has a right to strike back deep into Russia, though Kyiv’s Western backers have said they do not want a direct confrontation between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine about Tuesday’s attacks. Both sides deny targeting civilians. Tuesday’s attack follow drone attacks Ukraine launched in early September targeting chiefly Russia’s energy and power facilities. Authorities of the Tula region, which neighbors the Moscow region to its north, said drone wreckage fell onto a fuel and energy facility but the “technological process” of the facility was not affected.\n",

            "Hamas leaderYahya Sinwarhas written a rare letter to Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, according to the Lebanese militant group, in which he reaffirms his commitment to fighting Israel and supporting the Iran-backed alliance of regional militants known as the “Axis of Resistance.” Sinwar, Hamas’ political leader who is believed to be hiding underground in Gaza, told Nasrallah that the group is committed to the path of resistance taken by hisslain predecessor Ismail Haniyehand to the “unity of the Ummah (Islamic nation), at the heart of which is the Axis of Resistance, in the face of the Zionist project.” The letter, shared by Hezbollah’s Telegram channel, was written to show gratitude for Hezbollah’s ongoing fight against Israel, which began on October 8, just a day after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel that triggered a devastating Israeli assault on Gaza. One of Israel’s most wanted men, Sinwar hasn’t been seen since the war. He also hadn’t been publicly heard from for almost a year – until this week. On Tuesday, he issued his first statement since the war, congratulating Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune for his election victory, according to Hamas’ Telegram channel. The next day, his office said he wrote letters thanking those who offered condolences for Haniyeh’s death. And on Friday came the letter to Nasrallah. CNN cannot verify if Sinwar is indeed the author of the letters. “He’s trying to say I’m here, I’m alive, I’m very much in command. I’m constantly updated and aware of everything happening outside Gaza,” said Muhammad Shehada, a writer and analyst from Gaza. “He wants to show that he is able to operate on multiple fronts, the domestic front – the battlefield in Gaza – and the diplomatic front – mediations.” The target audience for such letters, he said, is primarily Israel, to whom Sinwar is attempting to show that despite efforts to find him, he is still able to continue working without interference. The other target, Shehada added, is Hamas, including “skeptics from inside the movement or even mediators like Qatar, the US and Egypt, who doubt that he might be able to fulfill his leadership role from the tunnels in Gaza.” Sinwar was named political leader of Hamas after Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran in July. He is seen as more hardline than his predecessor in dealings with Israel andfavors cooperationand closer ties with Iran and allied Islamist groups such as Hezbollah. Shehada said Sinwar is “one of the strongest advocates of a stronger relationship with Hezbollah and Iran, and deepening the alliance with the Axis of Resistance.” “He is perceived in the movement as pragmatic, but at the same time very unpredictable and impulsive. But pragmatic nonetheless,” he said. In his letter to Nasrallah, Sinwar vowed to continue defending Islamic holy sites, particularlyJerusalem’s Al Aqsa Mosque“until the expulsion and eradication of the occupation from our land, and the establishment of our independent state with full sovereignty and its capital Jerusalem.” The October 7 attack, he said, was “one of the most honorable battles in the history of our Palestinian people.”\n",

            "Taylor Swift was among the many stars to channel ’90s fashion at theMTV Video Music Awardson Wednesday, wearing a chic taffeta bustier and skirt by Dior. The yellow tartan was familiar, evoking one of the decade’s most iconic looks: The preppy Dolce and Gabbana blazer and pleated skirtwornby fictional character Cher Horowitz (played by Alicia Silverstone) in the 1995 hit movie “Clueless.” But this isn’t the first time Dior has nodded to the timeless on-screen outfit. In 2022, Natalie Portman donned a near-identical two piece for a Halloween costume, while Blackpink’s Jisoo, wore a version for the Dior Fall-Winter 2022 show in Paris. But with its punk-accented stylings, in the form of black buckles, collar and zipped fitted front, Swift’s version is, by far, the edgiest. Completing the look with velvet shorts, thigh-high boots and gloves, the gown was straight from Dior’s 2025 Cruise collection, which drew inspiration from Scottish craft traditions and Mary, Queen of Scots. Quoting its founder Christian Dior, the brand called tartan “the only fancy fabric that resists fashions” in the show notes. Models clad in gothic plaid pieces walked through the grand gardens of Drummond Castle, Perthshire in Scotland. The look on Wednesday night was a departure from Swift’s typical red carpet style. The megastar is usually never without a smattering of crystals, diamonds or sequins, often sticking to classic silhouettes and more overtly glamorous gowns. She even traded in her signature red lipstick for a dramatic black smokey eye. Swift won big at the Video Music Awards, nabbing seven of the ceremony’s “Moon Person” trophies, including its marquee prize: Video of the Year, for “Fortnight” with Post Malone. The pair also won Best Collaboration, and Swift used that acceptance speech to commemorate the September 11 attacks. “I’ve just been thinking about what happened 23 years ago, everyone who lost a loved one and everyone that we lost,” she said on stage. The star’s attendance at the VMAs came a day after sheendorsedKamala Harris for the US presidency, a move that made headlines around the world.\n",

            "Russia has revoked the accreditation of six British diplomats and accused them of spying on Moscow, it emerged Friday, a fresh geopolitical escalation that was publicized in Russian state media just as London and the US considerallowing Ukraine to strike targetsinside Russia. Moscow’s Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed without providing evidence that it had detected “signs of intelligence and subversive work” by the diplomats, and said it considered their actions “threatening the security of the Russian Federation.” Britain later said the expulsion occurred last month, and described the accusations as “completely baseless.” The diplomats left Russia weeks ago, and the British government is in the process of replacing them. The move was revealed hours after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Washington DC for meetings with US President Joe Biden about easing restrictions on Ukraine’s ability to strike Russian territory with Western weapons. Russia claimed Britain’s Foreign Office had transformed since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine into a body whose “main task is to inflict a strategic defeat on our country.” Russian state media later reported the identities of the six diplomats the country had expelled. The Foreign Office said in a statement on Friday that the expulsions were made in response to new measures announced by Britain’s previous government in May. That month, Rishi Sunak’s administrationsummoned the Russian ambassadorand expelled the Russian defense attaché, describing him as “an undeclared military intelligence officer.” “The accusations made today by the FSB against our staff are completely baseless,” Britain’s Foreign Office said Friday. “We are unapologetic about protecting our national interests,” it added. The delayed publicization of the move in Russia appeared timed to coincide with Starmer’s meeting with Biden, which itself follows a visit by Britain’s Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, to Kyiv, where he and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky’s government has beenpressing both countriesto allow the Ukrainian military to fire long-range Western weapons deep into Russian territory, after Kyiv’s surprise incursion into the Russian border region of Kursk. Biden has signaleda new opennessin allowing Ukraine to fire missiles provided by the West on targets deep inside Russia. Ahead of the meeting between Starmer and Biden, US officials said they did not expect Biden would immediately sign-off on allowing US-provided Army Tactical Missile Systems — known as ATACMS — to be launched on targets inside Russia far from the Ukrainian border. Under discussion is whether the US could give the go ahead to Ukraine using similar systems provided by Britain and France. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned NATO alliance leaders on Thursday that a move to lift the restrictions would be considered an act of war. “This will mean that NATO countries – the United States and European countries – are at war with Russia. And if this is the case, then, bearing in mind the change in the essence of the conflict, we will make appropriate decisions in response to the threats that will be posed to us,” Putin told reporters. Britain and Russia have traded diplomatic curbs and sanctions since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Moscow frequently making tit-for-tat moves at critical junctures in its war with Ukraine. Russia has banned a number of British lawmakers, officials and journalists from entering its territory in the past two years.\n",

            "Francine has strengthened into a Category 1hurricanewith maximum sustained winds of 90 mph and is forecast to keep strengthening – possibly to a Category 2 storm – ahead of landfall along the Louisiana coast Wednesday. Francine was about 245 miles from Morgan City, Louisiana, early Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The center earlier issued a hurricane watch for the New Orleans area as the forecast track shifted slightly eastward. Forecasters expect the hurricane to continue strengthening inthe record-warm Gulf of Mexicothrough Wednesday morning and make landfall Wednesday afternoon or evening. Sustained winds could reach 100 mph prior to landfall, thehurricane center said. In Louisiana, some communities were evacuating and slamming closed their floodgates in anticipation of the storm’s likely landfall there. The Federal Emergency Management Agencyencouragedthose in the path of Francine to prepare as it “poses a serious threat.” “Do not wait until the last minute – Francine is intensifying quickly and immediate action is critical,” the agency said. Track the Storm:See the latest spaghetti models andother storm maps here. The strong storm doused parts of far South Texas with a few inches of flooding rain and gusty winds Tuesday morning, but started to pull away Tuesday and track northeast through the Gulf of Mexico where it will start to intensify once again after battling hostile conditions overnight. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday the state is preparing potential impacts from heavy rain and winds, noting, “This is not an unusual storm.” “It’s a storm that we are equipped and should be equipped to deal with,” he said. The storm’s projected path has also been nudging to the east, which could aid intensification by giving it more time over the water and also implicate more of the New Orleans area. Because of the eastward shift, coastal Mississippi and Alabama are were placed under tropical storm and storm surge watches and warnings. The storm could encounter more hostile conditions that could limit its strength before landfall, but it will not change the overall impact: Flooding rainfall, powerful winds and potentially life-threatening storm surge threaten to flood roads and cause extensive damage to homes and widespread power outages. The most severe impacts are likely to be felt in southern Louisiana around the time of landfall, but the storm will be felt long before that over a wider area of the Gulf Coast. Rain and scattered thunderstorms will continue along parts of the upper Texas and Louisiana coasts until Francine’s rain bands arrive overnight into Wednesday morning. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive as early as Wednesday morning. A storm’s winds may determine its official strength, but its the water that is most likely to kill. Francine is no different. Francine will push several feet of the Gulf of Mexico onto normally dry areas across the western Gulf Coast in what’s calledstorm surge. Storm surge watches and warnings stretch along the coast from far northeastern Texas to the Mississippi-Alabama line. The storm surge threat here is the reason behind several evacuation orders across the Louisiana and Gulf coasts. Water levels will begin to rise most severely as Francine nears a potential landfall along the central Louisiana coast, where surge levels could reach 10 feet above normal. Heavy rain-caused flooding also presents a significant threat. Flood watches have been hoisted for parts of the Gulf Coast – some areas that are expected to get doused by Francine were soaked by a non-tropical system last week, so it will take less rain to cause flash flooding. The outer rain bands of the storm could begin to impact the Gulf Coast Tuesday night, though the most torrential conditions will hold off until Wednesday morning. The storm is expected to bring rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches from the coastline of northeast Mexico to southern Mississippi, and some places in southeast Louisiana could see as much as 12 inches. The storm should weaken quickly as it moves onshore Wednesday, but rainfall is expected to drench parts of the lower and middle Mississippi River Valley through the rest of the week. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landryissueda statewide emergency declaration Monday, and FEMA said Tuesday they are working with local authorities to make sure resources are given quickly. Evacuation orders expanded along the state’s coast Tuesday. In Jefferson Parish - which includes parts of the greater New Orleans area - mandatory evacuations were issued for areas outside of the levee protection system, Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng said in a news conference Monday. “I will be signing an emergency declaration (Monday) in anticipation of Tropical Storm Francine,” Lee Shang said. “I will also order a mandatory evacuation for those outside of the levee protection system, including Grand Isle and Lafitte, due to potentially life-threatening storm surge.” Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were set to go into effectin parts of Lafourche Parishon Tuesday afternoon, according the parish government. Mandatory evacuations were also in placefor Zone 1in Terrebonne Parish, the parish government said. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued Monday for the majority of Louisiana’s Cameron Parish, according to an official’ssocial media. Both mandatory and voluntary evacuations were ordered farther east in Jefferson Parish’s town ofGrand Isle, which wasdecimatedby the Category 4 storm Ida in 2021. The parishes of Iberia, Terrebonne and Lafourche have mandated curfews ahead of landfall, and St. Mary and Terrebonne parishes started toclose off floodgatesand distribute sand bags Monday. Terrebonne Parish also declared astate of emergency, according to a news release. Schools are closed across several Louisiana parishes on Wednesday and Thursday, includingJefferson,TerrebonneandOrleans, which encompasses New Orleans. In Mississippi, people in the city ofPass Christianhave begun to voluntarily evacuate. CNN’s Amanda Musa and Taylor Romine contributed to this report.\n",

            "Dozens of people have been arrested after clashes between police and protesters outside a major defense expo in Australia on Wednesday, during which police fired rubber bullets at demonstrators and both sides accused the other of violence. Video from the scene showed protesters setting fire to trash cans and throwing projectiles at officers as they struggled to restore order at the Land Forces international exposition in downtown Melbourne. The three-day event brings defense experts from around the world and showcases military equipment, heavy-duty trucks, semi-automatic guns and other weapons. The protests come at a time when heightened tensions sparked by global conflicts have deepened public anger in many countries towards the arms industry and its profits. Victoria Police had expected protests and deployed more than 1,000 officers to the event in their biggest planned operation in 24 years. When protesters arrived Wednesday, rows of officers were already guarding the exhibition center ready to repel any attempt to interfere with the event. By mid-morning, around 500 protesters were outside the venue, according to Gabrielle de Vietri, a member of the Victorian Greens who sits in the state parliament. She said she arrived around 10 a.m. and witnessed police using “excessive force.” “I saw people with blood running down their faces having been shot in the face by rubber bullets, people with welts on their arms from being shot, people who had torn their clothes off from being sprayed with pepper spray. It was a horrific scene of police brutality,” de Vietri told CNN. However, Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said complaints police used excessive force were “rubbish,” calling the protesters “hypocrites” for their behavior which he said was “absolutely appalling.” “I’ve used the term hypocrites because we support peaceful protest, and we facilitate that all the time. What we saw today was not peaceful protest,” Patton told a news conference later Wednesday. He said police had been abused, pushed, shoved, and had bottles and balloons thrown at them containing liquid that analysis showed to be “low-level acid that caused irritants.” Police horses had been punched and horse manure was thrown at officers, Patton said, adding that of around 1,200 protesters, 39 had been arrested for various offenses including obstructing police, assault, arson and blocking roadways. “We were forced to deploy some non-lethal munitions, which we did, and I’m still of the view that they were appropriately deployed and appropriate risk assessments were made,” he said, confirming that police used rubber bullets, flash distraction devices and pepper spray. Two dozen police officers required medical treatment, a police spokesperson told CNN, adding that while police horses were also targeted, none sustained serious injuries. An Ambulance Victoria spokesperson said two people were taken to hospital but couldn’t say if they were involved in the protests. Members of the crowd, many waving Palestinian flags and chanting pro-Palestinian slogans, demanded an end to violent conflict, CNN affiliate 9 News reported. The organization behind the protests, Disrupt Land Forces, said in anopen letterthey “unequivocally oppose the glorification of death, destruction, and genocide being carried out with weapons developed on this continent and showcased at Land Forces.” The group called for an end to funding “states engaged in genocide and militarized repression,” including Israel. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on Hamas, according to the health ministry in the enclave. The Israeli government has vowed to wipe out Hamas following the group’s attacks on October 7, in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s offensive in Gaza is being investigated by the International Court of Justice, in a case lodged by South Africa which accused Israel of genocide against Palestinian people. Israel has denied that characterization as “grossly distorted.” Protesters heckled attendees making their way into the expo, which was expected to host around 1,000 firms from 31 countries, 9 News reported. “We have seen many delegates coming through and we want to make it uncomfortable for these (people) to go inside and make million-dollar contracts and buy more weapons or sell weapons that are going to be used to commit genocide in Palestine and other places in the world,” protester Natalie Farah told 9 News. Jacinta Allan, Victoria state premier, strongly criticized any protesters making threats or using violence against police officers. “They’re doing their job supporting community safety,” Allan told Australian public broadcaster, the ABC. “They deserve to be treated absolutely with respect by people who are attending this protest.” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said people had the right to protest but had to do so peacefully. “You don’t say you’re opposed to defense equipment by throwing things at police. They’ve got a job to do and our police officers should be respected at all times,” Albanese told CNN affiliate Channel 7. Speaking to ABC Radio National from Melbourne before the conference started on Wednesday, Bec Shrimpton, director of defense strategy and national security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said “it’s very unfair to tarnish everybody with a genocide brush.” “The world is not as we would all like it to be and it is not a peaceful and stable place at the moment. Things like this event are actually really, really important to help with the defense of our nation and our national interests,” Shrimpton said. Earlier Wednesday de Vietri, the Greens MP, said the state government was “turning our city into a display of war machines, spending millions to protect the profits of genocide.” “We pleaded for them to cancel Land Forces, but they didn’t listen. Disruption is all we have left,” de Vietriwrote on X. The Victorian Greens have called for an independent inquiry into Victoria Police’s use of force at the protests, according to apost by the leader to X.\n",

            "Pope Francishas repeated his divisive comments that in some countries people prefer having pets to children, a message that has struck a chord with many conservatives around the world. The idea has re-entered the American political dialogue in the wake of a resurfaced clip of now-Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance criticizing some prominent Democrats as “childless cat ladies.” Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019 and haswritten about his journey to joining the Catholic Church, also sent a series of emails that called Democratic leaders “childless sociopaths” who “don’t have a direct stake in this country.” Pope Francis, 87, who is in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, made his remarks to political leaders as part of a 12-day tour of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. He said, “You’re an example for everyone, for all the countries that maybe, and this might sound funny, these families prefer to have a cat or a little dog instead of a child.” President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo laughed at the remark with Francis turning to him and saying, “it’s true, isn’t it?” Francis has in the past criticized couples who choose to have pets rather than children, saying this “takes away our humanity.” He has lamented low birth rates in Europe, particularly on his doorstep in Italy, and has backed plans by three government led by Giorgia Meloni to reverse the trend. While US President Donald Trump’s running mate and Francis may agree on the importance of having children, the pope’s approach is at odds with Trumpism when it comes to migrants and climate change. In 2016, Francis described then presidential candidate Trump’s plan to build a wall to stop migrants the US-Mexico border as “not Christian.”\n",

            "The death of a beloved white beluga whale has turned into a mystery in Norway as animal rights groups speculate whether he was actually assassinated. The beluga, nicknamed Hvaldimir, rose to fame in 2019 after being spotted wearing a specially-made harness with mounts for a camera, sparking claims that the animal may have been trained by the Russian military. Two Norwegian animal rights groups alleged on Wednesday that the whale was “shot to death” after Hvaldimir was found dead over the weekend in southern Norway. OneWhale and NOAH are calling for a criminal investigation “based on compelling evidence that the whale was killed by gunshot wounds,” OneWhale, which describes itself as a “nonprofit committed to protecting Hvaldimir and relocating him to a wild population of belugas,”wrote in an Instagram post. It added that “several veterinarians, biologists, and ballistics experts have reviewed [the] evidence of Hvaldimir’s injuries, determining that the whale’s death was the result of a criminal act.” The post included pictures of what appeared to be holes and streaks of blood on the lifeless body of the whale. CNN is unable to independently verify their claim that the whale was shot. The organizations filed a police report to the Sandnes Police District and the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime. The Southwestern Police District confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that it has received a request to investigate the death of Hvaldimir, though the unit has not yet determined whether it will open a formal inquiry. “I don’t think we’ve had a case like this before,” said Southwestern Police District Superintendent Victor Fenne-jensen, who declined to comment on whether his department had investigated rumors that the whale was a Russian spy. He added, Hvaldimir was “kind of a celebrity.” However, Marine Mind, another non-profit that advocates for protecting marine life, has called the public to “refrain from speculation” until the country’s Veterinary Institute has finished its own investigation. It was Marine Mind that found Hvaldimir’s body in the bay. “When we found Hvaldimir on Saturday, it was not possible to immediately determine the cause of death, and therefore it is important to refrain from speculation until the institute has completed its work,” Marine Mind posted to its Facebook page on Wednesday. Before Hvaldimir’s death, OneWhale and NOAH had been collaborating to relocate him to a safer area in northern Norway, and had obtained permits from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. CNN has reached out to the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment for comment. Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported that his body was found floating at the Risavika Bay in southern Norway Saturday by a father and son who were fishing, according to the Associated Press (AP). The beluga,named by combining the Norwegian word for whale —hval— and the first name of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was lifted out of the water with a crane and taken to a nearby harbor where experts for experts to examine, AP reported. Marine biologist Sebastian Strand told NRK Hvaldimir’s cause of death was not immediately clear and that no major external injuries were visible on the animal, the AP reported. Back in 2019, experts told CNN that Hvaldimir was a trained animal, and evidence suggested that the whale had come from Russia. Jorgen Ree Wiig, a marine biologist at Norway’s Directorate of Fisheries, told CNN that the Hvaldimir’s harness appeared “specially made” and had “mounts for GoPro cameras on each side of it.” That the harness clips read “Equipment St. Petersburg” only contributed to the popular theory that he came from Murmansk, Russia, and was trained by the Russian navy.\n",

            "Shots were fired during the Israeli military’s hours-long detention of a convoy of United Nations vehicles in Gaza, the UN Secretary General’s spokesperson said Tuesday. The situation “escalated quickly” after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stopped the convoy at a checkpoint on Monday and demanded to take two of its 12 passengers for questioning, according to the spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric. Dujarric said the Israeli soldiers had pointed their weapons at the UN personnel and that at some point during the incident “shots were fired.” He said IDF tanks and bulldozers then “proceeded to ram the UN vehicles from the back and front, compacting the convoy with UN staff still inside.” “One bulldozer dropped debris on the first vehicle, while Israeli soldiers threatened staff, making it impossible for them to safely exit their vehicles,” he added. The convoy was later released and UN officials have confirmed their staff returned safely to a UN base. CNN has asked the IDF for comment on Dujarric’s account of the incident, which took place at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint. Previously, the IDF said it had acted “following intelligence that a number of Palestinian suspects were present in the convoy.” The Israeli military had also claimed previously that the convoy was not involved in the transport of polio vaccines but was being used instead to exchange UN personnel. However, the UN has insisted that the convoy was involved in polio vaccinations and contained national and international staff members who were meant to be rolling out the  campaign for children in Gaza City and northern Gaza. Dujarric said that despite the incident, vaccinations were able to begin in northern Gaza on Tuesday – the third phase of the UN-led campaign which is expected to continue through Thursday. On Monday, Philippe Lazzarini, chief of theUNWRA– the UN’s main agency for Palestinian humanitarian relief – criticized the IDF’s conduct in the incident as “the latest in a series of violations against UN staff including shootings at convoys and arrests by the Israeli Armed Forces at checkpoints despite prior notification.”\n",

            "Many New Yorkers will gladly tell anyone who’ll listen – and even those who won’t – about how they have the best pizza. And now they’ve got some mouth-watering new back-up for their long-standing culinary claims. This week, the Italy-based50 Top Pizza Awardscame out with its 2024 worldwide list, and a Lower East Side restaurant came out on top. Una Pizza Napoletana, opened by pizza maestro Anthony Mangieri in March 2022, not only beat out US competitors but also global ones. That includes pizzerias inNaples, Italy, the holy land for pizza aficionados and foodies in general. “It’s inspiring to be recognized for this 30 years into my career, especially in Naples where pizza originated,” Mangieri said in an email to CNN Travel on Thursday. Adding to their bragging rights, New Yorkers saw three other pizzerias make the 2024 list, which included 101 restaurants in total (despite the “50” in the name of the awards). The rankings for the other New York pizzerias wereRibaltaat No. 19,Don Antonioat No. 30 andL’industrie Pizzeriaat No. 80. Italy still managed to dominate the overall list with 41 eateries while the United States got a total of 15 places recognized. And Naples managed to best New York with five entries on the list, including a tie for the No. 2 spot withDiego Vigtaliano Pizzeria. Showing how truly global the awards are, nations not exactly known for their pizza scenes –South Korea, Bolivia and India, to name three ­– were represented on the list. The 50 Top Pizza Awards explained how Una nabbed the highest honor on its website. “In a country always accustomed to putting everything on pizza, Anthony proposes only the purest tradition in toppings, with extraordinary quality ingredients. Marinara, Margherita, Cosacca, and a pizza that changes every day, based on market ingredients,” the Awards site said. Mangieri, whogrew up in New Jersey, developed “a pizza obsession at a young age,” a media representative for the restaurant said in an email to CNN Travel. His mother ended up driving him to all the well-known spots in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut in his quest for the “perfect pizza.” Mangieri “focuses on naturally leavened, wood-fired pizzas with ingredients like the best San Marzano tomatoes, Amalfi wild oregano, buffalo mozzarella DOP, and Sicilian sea salt,” the representative said. “He chose to have only one location to allow for an obsessive focus on every detail.” Mangieri focuses on the basics to achieve his results. “What makes a really good pizza is first the dough. It’s not a specific recipe, but it’s about hydration and understanding how to work the dough and being able to adapt to all the variables involved,” he told CNN Travel. “At Una, what makes us different is our dough is naturally leavened and highly hydrated, never refrigerated, made with a mixture of many different of Italian flours, and I make the dough every day we’re open.” Una Pizza Napoletana should appeal to the “slow food” crowd. It bakes only three pizzas at the time in its wood-fired ovens. The current location at 175 Orchard Street, just off Houston Street, is actually the sixth iteration of the restaurant and has been open since March 2022. For people more about frozen sweets than hot pizza, the 50 Top Pizza Awards also praised the homemade ice cream and seasonal sorbets at Una. As far as the acclaim goes, Mangieri said, “The recognition is appreciated, but in the end it’s not why I started and not why I continue to make every ball of dough we serve at Una after all these years. It fuels us to go into the restaurant every day and give more love and focus, and not to take anything for granted.” And what does this pizza master enjoy eating himself? “Pasta, and I eat it for almost every meal. Or my fiancée’s Mexican cooking.” If you’re hoping to drop by for a pie at Una, you’ll have to wait until October 4. Mangieri and his team have closed the place while they travel in Italy. For 2024, here are the top pizzerias around the world, according to the 50 Top Pizza Awards: 1. Una Pizza Napoletana(New York, USA)2. (tie) Diego Vitagliano Pizzeria(Naples, Italy)2.

            "The Mexican Senate narrowly passed a controversial judicial reform early Wednesday, hours after protesters broke into the chamber in a chaotic scene and forced a suspension of the proceedings. The Senate vote was the last major hurdle for the sweeping constitutional reform, under which Mexicans would elect judges at all levels of government by a popular vote. Opposition has swelled in recent weeks to the effort, which has been championed by the outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Judicial staff across the country, including from the Supreme Court, have been on strike, shuttering most courthouse activity. Dramatic footage from the Senate showed protesters bursting through a door to the floor after a chaotic scrum with officials, while others waved the Mexican flag and chanted from a gallery above. Some lawmakers were seen cheering on the demonstrators. At least one person was injured in the unrest, according to the Senate communications team, and an opposition senator said protesters threw gasoline in his eyes. López Obrador, a popular leftist, has long been critical of his country’s Supreme Court after it stood in the way of some of his signature policy proposals. He has said the overhaul is necessary to rid Mexico’s judiciary of corruption and ensure it is responsive to popular will. He welcomed the result of the vote at a press briefing on Wednesday in which he acknowledged the controversy surrounding the reform. “Well, it is a decision that the legislators made and I would say freely. This does not satisfy many. Others, yes, are pleased that this reform has been approved. I am among the latter,” he said. His successor, President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, who takes office in October, echoed those sentiments. “With the election of judges, magistrates, and ministers, the administration of justice in our country will be strengthened. The regime of corruption and privileges is becoming more and more a thing of the past and a true democracy and a true rule of law are being built,” she wrote on X. Critics of the reform call it a power grab that will compromise one of the last remaining checks on presidential power. Legal experts say the proposed procedure would turn Mexico into an international outlier. The Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center slammed the Senate’s approval on Wednesday, saying the reform “annuls the division of powers” and generates “democratic erosion.” The reformsailed through the lower chamber of Congress last week, but López Obrador’s ruling coalition needed a supermajority to approve it in the upper house. In recent days, opposition lawmakers have reported being bribed and pressured with blackmail to change their vote, according to Senator Guadalupe Murguía, the coordinator of senators for the National Action Party (PAN). After reconvening in a second location that was fortified by dozens of police officers in riot gear, the reform passed, with 86 votes in favor, 41 against and zero abstentions. A majority of Mexico’s 32 state legislatures must now approve the overhaul, which is expected to happen. On Wednesday, Oaxaca and Tamaulipas became the first and second states to ratify it, just hours after the Senate’s approval. The first judicial elections could take place as soon as next year. The reform faced a rare and stinging critique from US Ambassador Ken Salazar in Mexico City, in which he called the election of judges “a major risk to the functioning of Mexico’s democracy.” His comments have led to aspatbetween the countries. Warnings from business groups that the reform could undermine the Mexican investment environment have sent the value of the peso tumbling. Supreme Court judges in Mexico are usually nominated by the president and must be approved in the Senate. Federal judges are selected by a judicial commission that uses professional exams and coursework to evaluate candidates on a meritocratic basis. If adopted, about 7,000 judges would be required to battle for their seats, or turn the gavel over to the most popular candidate. This story has been updated.\n",

            "Typhoon Yagi, Asia’s most powerful storm this year, has left dozens dead since sweeping across southern China and Southeast Asia last week, leaving a trail of destruction with its intense rainfall and powerful winds. After hitting the Philippines, where it killed more than a dozen people, it churned westwards towardssouthern Chinaand shortly after parts of Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos. Nearly a week since it made landfall, many farms and villages in northern parts of Vietnam and neighboring Thailand remain under water as communities struggle to cope with severe flooding and the looming threat of landslides. In Vietnam, the death toll has risen to at least 226 as a result of the storm and the landslides and flash floods it triggered, the government’s disaster agency said Thursday, according to Reuters. The storm caused widespread damage to infrastructure and factories. Video captured by a car’s dashcam earlier this week showed the moment asteel bridge collapsedover the engorged Red River in Vietnam’s Phu Tho province, plunging drivers into the raging waters. The downpours also inundated Thailand’s northern province of Chiang Rai, submerging homes and riverside villages, making rescue efforts difficult. At least 33 people have died across Thailand since mid-August due to rain-related incidents, with at least nine deaths this week after Yagi, Reuters reported citing the local government. Storms are being made more intense and deadlier by the warming ocean, scientists have long warned. While developed nations bear a greater historical responsibility for the human-induced climate crisis, developing nations and small-island states are suffering the worst impacts.\n",

            "The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are probing a near-collision between two planes on an airport runway in Nashville Thursday morning — the latest close call involving commercial flights. The crew of Alaska Airlines flight 369 “discontinued their takeoff” at Nashville International Airport around 9:15 a.m. CT when Southwest Airlines flight 2029 “was cleared to cross the end of the same runway,” according to the FAA. It is not clear how close the two aircraft came to colliding. The Alaska Airlines flight carrying 176 passengers and six crew members braked so suddenly that the crew “reported blown tires during the braking,” the FAA said. No injuries were reported. “The Alaska aircraft, on its way to Seattle, had received clearance for takeoff from Air Traffic Control,” Alaska Airlines said in a statement. “We’re grateful for the expertise of our pilots who immediately applied the brakes to prevent the incident from escalating.” Southwest Airlines said in a statement it is in “contact with the FAA and NTSB and will participate in the investigation” and “nothing is more important to Southwest than the Safety of our Customers and Employees.” The NTSB is investigating the incident between the Alaska Airlines plane, a Boeing 737 Max 9, and the Southwest Airlines aircraft, a Boeing 737-700, the agency said in aposton X. This is the 14th NTSB runway incursion investigation involving commercial or for-hire flights since the start of 2023. The incident in Nashville also comes just two days aftertwo Delta Air Lines planes collidedas both were taxiing for takeoff from Atlanta’s busy Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Just two months ago, a commercial flight at New York’s Syracuse Hancock International Airportaborted a landingas another plane was taking off from the same runway it intended to use. There has been heightened awareness of runway incursions involving commercial flights at major airports after anear collision involving two planeson a runway at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in January 2023. The close call triggered multiple investigations and pushed the FAA to convene arare, daylong safety summit. A June NTSBreport laterfound that the incident at JFK was caused by pilots who wererepeatedly distractedin the cockpit. Investigators at the time called for the FAA to install more technology at airports that can warn air traffic controllers of a possible collision on a runway. One of the country’s closest near-collisions in years happened a month later,in February 2023, between a FedEx cargo plane trying to land and a Southwest Airlines jet trying to take off on an airport runway in Austin, Texas. Investigators in aJune hearingsaid that it happened because of an air traffic controller’s faulty assumptions amid heavy fog. The NTSB issued seven recommendations based on the Austin incident, including installing technology at all commercial airports to detect movement of planes and vehicles on the ground. The NTSB also called on the FAA to require pilots to report their position frequently when taxiing in limited visibility conditions.\n",

            "A Singaporean man has been ordered to repay more than 38 million Australian dollars ($25.7 million) after he lost big during a gambling spree at an Australian casino over the span of a few days. Queensland’s Supreme Court ruled Monday that Yew Choy Wong owed that amount to the Star Gold Coast, as well as the casino’s legal fees and interest. He had racked up losses of 47.3 million Australian dollars ($31.5 million) there between July 26 and August 2, 2018. Wong fled the country without settling his bill,according tocourt documents. The casino tried to recoup its losses using a blank check Wong had given its sister property, the Star Sydney, a year prior, but that check bounced after Wong told his bank not to pay out any checks from the Star, the ruling said. The casino then tried to recover the debt in 2019 by suing Wong in Singapore, but that case was dismissed a year later because Singaporean law largely prohibits the recovery of gambling debts. According to court documents from that case, Wong frequently played the card game baccarat at the Star’s casinos, during which he and his “entourage of some 28 people” were flown to Queensland by the casino and housed in its private salons. In the more recent case, Wong argued he did not owe the Star any money because he had complained about the way the casino’s dealers had dealt cards to him, after which he stopped gambling. Wong said he resumed gambling after the Star’s chief operating officer, Paul Arbuckle, verbally agreed that Wong would not have to pay for losses he had already incurred and that the casino would waive any further losses, if the dealers repeated their alleged mistakes. Arbuckle denied making this agreement, according to the ruling. Star Entertainment, which owns the Gold Coast casino, declined to comment on the case. CNN has reached out to Wong’s representatives. In a letter presented to the court, which was addressed to Wong and signed by Arbuckle, the COO apologized for “difficulties” Wong experienced during his visit, but noted the mistakes would have had no direct financial impact on Wong. The letter did not mention waiving Wong’s debt. The casino also paid Wong hundreds of thousands of dollars in goodwill payments following his complaints, the ruling said. Justice Melanie Hindman said: “The alleged agreement pleaded by Dr Wong is not evidenced by the letter of apology or otherwise supported by any other evidence adduced in the trial.”\n",

            "China’s historic attempt to bring samples from Mars to Earth could launch as soon as 2028, two years earlier than previously stated, according to a senior mission official. The country’s Tianwen-3 mission would carry out two launches “around 2028” to retrieve the Martian samples, chief mission designer Liu Jizhong said at a deep-space exploration event in eastern China’s Anhui province last week. The projected mission launch is more ambitious than a 2030 targetannouncedby space officials earlier this year, though the timeline has fluctuated in recent years. A 2028 target appears to return to a launch plandescribedin 2022 by a senior scientist involved with the Tianwen program – a mission profile that would see samples returned to Earth by 2031. The latest remarks followChina’s landmark successretrieving the first samples from the far side of the moon in June. It also comes as an effort by NASA and the European Space Agency to retrieve Mars samples remains under assessment amid concerns over budget, complexity and risk. The US space agency, which first landed on Mars decades ago, said it isevaluatingfaster and more affordable plans to allow for a speedier result than one that would have returned samples in 2040. Becoming the first country to return samples from Mars would be a significant accomplishment for China’s ambitious space program and leader Xi Jinping’s stated “eternal dream” to make the country a space power. China’s advances – includinguncrewed lunar missionsand the establishment of its ownorbital space station– come as the US and other countries have ramped up their own space programs amid a growing focus on the potential access to resources and scientific benefits of lunar and deep space exploration. A key priority of China’s Tianwen-3 mission would be to search for traces of life on Mars. The mission would also attempt technical breakthroughs in surface sampling, takeoff and ascent from the Martian surface, as well as a spacecraft rendezvous in Mars’ orbit, Liu said last week, according to Chinese state media. In a separate interview with CGTN, the international division of China’s state broadcaster, Liu stressed the challenges associated with the mission, which is slated to involve two initial rocket launches and an unprecedented rocket launch off another planet to return the samples. “The return mission requires launch from the surface of Mars. It’s actually a small rocket launch – therefore it will be very difficult to ensure the entire flight is reliable,” he said. China would engage in international cooperation around the mission, including carrying other countries’ payloads and sample and data sharing, as well as planning for future Mars research, Liu was also quoted as saying. Mars has long been seen by scientists as a critical research destination that could reveal information about the existence of life outside Earth – and our own origins in the solar system. China’s Tianwen planetary exploration mission series, whose name roughly translates to “questions to heaven,” had its first success in 2021, when its Tianwen-1 probe reached Mars’ orbit and deployed theZhurong rover to the planet’s surface. Zhurong’s May 15, 2021, landing in a large plain known as Utopia Planitia made China the third country after the Soviet Union and the United States to touch down on the planet, which at its closest is more than 30 million miles from Earth. The rover’s primary mission was to search for signs of ancient life and investigate minerals, environment and distribution of water and ice in the plain. Data returned from the rover’s initial survey of the basin suggested that the Utopia Planitia basin hadcontained waterduring a period of time tens of millions of years ago when many scientists believed Mars to be dry and cold, according to 2022 research. The rover was designed to have a working duration of 90 days on Mars, but continued for 358 days and traveled 1,921 meters (6,302 feet) on the planet. Itwent into hibernationin May 2022 due to what Chinese scientists said was an “unpredictable accumulation” of dust. The US had its first landing on the planet in 1976 with its Viking 1 mission, which included a lander that operated for more than six years. It was a feat that surpassed the Soviet Union’s Mars 3 spacecraft, which landed on the Martian surface in 1971, but only transmitted signal for some20 seconds. The most recent US landing on Mars was that ofNASA’s Perseverance rover, which touched down in the Jezero crater in 2021 and has since been collecting samples for a later return to Earth. NASA chief Bill Nelson earlier this yearcalledthe US’ planned Mars sample return mission “one of the most complex missions NASA has ever undertaken.” The US space agencyannouncedin April that it was seekingnew, innovative waysto retrieve surface samples, after a budget plan ballooned to as much as $11 billion with a timeframe of sample returns by 2040. In June, itannouncedit was backing a handful of 90-day studies to find “more affordable and faster” methods.\n",

            "The man accused of dousing in petrol and setting alight Olympic runnerRebecca Cheptegeihas died from burns sustained during the fatal attack on the Ugandan athlete, a hospital official said on Tuesday. Cheptegei, 33, who competed in the marathon at the Paris Olympics, suffered burns to more than 75% of her body in the Sept. 1 attack anddied four days later. Her former boyfriend, Dickson Ndiema Marangach, died at 6.30 p.m. (11.30 a.m. ET) on Monday, said Philip Kirwa, chief executive officer of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret in western Kenya where Marangach was being treated and where Cheptegei also died. “He developed respiratory failure as a result of the severe airway burns and sepsis that led to his eventual death,” Kirwa said in a statement. Kirwa said Marangach had suffered over 41% burns following his assault on Cheptegei, which local media reported to have happened after she returned home from church with her children. Cheptegei, who finished 44th in Paris, is the third elite sportswoman to be killed in Kenya since October 2021. Her death hasput the spotlighton domestic violence in the East African country, particularly within its running community. “This guy is dead because he killed my daughter. He has died because of his actions,” Cheptegei’s father, Joseph Cheptegei, told Reuters. Rights groups say female athletes in Kenya, where many international runners train in the high-altitude highlands, are at a high risk of exploitation and violence at the hands of men drawn to their prize money, which far exceeds local incomes. “Justice really would have been for him to sit in jail and think about what he had done. This is not positive news whatsoever,” said Viola Cheptoo, co-founder of Tirop’s Angels, a support group for survivors of domestic violence in Kenya’s athletic community. “The shock of Rebecca’s death is still fresh,” Cheptoo told Reuters. Cheptoo co-founded Tirop’s Angels in memory of Agnes Tirop, a rising star in Kenya’s highly competitive athletics scene, who was found dead in her home in the town of Iten in October 2021, with multiple stab wounds to the neck. Ibrahim Rotich, Tirop’s husband, was charged with her murder and has pleaded not guilty. The case is ongoing. Nearly 34% of Kenyan girls and women aged 15-49 years have sufferedphysical violence, according to government data from 2022, with married women at particular risk. The 2022 survey found that 41% of married women had faced violence. Globally, a woman is killed by someone in her own family every 11 minutes, according to a 2023 UN Women study. “I don’t wish bad things on anyone, but of course I would have loved for him to face the law as an example for others so that these attacks on women can stop,” Beatrice Ayikoru, secretary-general of the Uganda Olympic Committee, told Reuters.\n",

            "On Tuesday,AT&T wireless servicewent down for some customers, affecting their ability to contact 911 in the event of an emergency. It was fixed in a few hours, with the company blaming a software issue, but it’s just one of many problems the telecommunications company has faced over the past several months, including outages and data breaches that have hampered its operations and left users in the lurch. In Februaryits network went down for 11 hours, preventing many of its customers across the United States from placing calls, texting or accessing the internet. AT&T said an initial review of the outage found it may have been caused by an error within the company and not a cyberattack. Afew weeks later in March, a data leak that included personal information of 73 million current and former customers was released into the “dark web,” sparking security concerns. The data came from 2019 or earlier and did not appear to contain financial information or specifics about call history, the company said. “It is not yet known whether the data … originated from AT&T or one of its vendors,” the company said at the time. Then,in June,another AT&T outage prevented some customers from completing calls between carriers. The issue was solved within a few hours, but the company didn’t reveal what caused the issue. And a security nightmare wasrevealed last monthwhen the call and text message records from mid-to-late 2022 of tens of millions of AT&T cellphone customers and many non-AT&T customers were exposed in a massive data breach. Compromised data included the telephone numbers of “nearly all” of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022. Notably, Tuesday’s outage came just hours after the Federal Communications Commissionannounceda $950,000 settlement with AT&T to resolve an investigation into whether or not the company violated FCC rules by failing to deliver 911 calls and timely notify 911 call centers during a previous outage in August 2023. So, why does this keep happening to AT&T? One telecommunications expert with whom CNN spoke believes it’s a combination of three issues, including overloaded networks in major cities, software updates that have gone haywire and various technical problems. On Tuesday, an outage map showed disruptions in New York; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston and Chicago. Alex Besen, founder and CEO of Besen Group, which analyzes mobile phone companies, said that led him believe it was a network overload issue. “To avoid any future outages, AT&T needs to increase the number of cell towers, implement advanced load-balancing techniques, use network optimization tools to manage traffic more effectively and prioritize services that can reduce congestion,” Besen told CNN. Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College, said AT&T’s response about Tuesday’s outage being a software issue left it “unclear if that is on the implementation side or a bug in the code.” “Customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with AT&T for repeated outages and customer service leaving the issue unresolved as they await critical updates,” Lightman told CNN. He added that, in AT&T’s defense, it’s “also important to note the complexity of the network infrastructure to service 115 million wireless subs as well as their aggressive rollout plans of new networks.” “Our customers expect and deserve reliable connectivity,” an AT&T spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “When service disruptions occur, our team of network experts work to restore service as quickly as possible. We value our customers and keeping them connected is our top priority.” This story has been updated with additional developments and context.\n",

            "US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has called for “fundamental changes” to the way Israeli forces operate in the occupied West Bank after the killing of American activistAysenur Ezgi Eygiat a protest last week. Blinken’s sharply worded rebuke came after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Tuesday that it was “highly likely” that Eygi was “hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire.” In its initial inquiry into the incident, the IDF said that the shot was not aimed at the activist, but at “the key instigator” of a “violent riot” at the Beita Junction where it said Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at Israeli security forces. It didn’t name the alleged instigator. The International Solidarity Movement (ISM), with whom Eygi had been volunteering, said that its protest on September 6 was peaceful. At a news conference in London on Tuesday, Blinken said Eygi’s killing was “unprovoked and unjustified” and demanded changes to the rules of engagement of Israel forces operating in the West Bank. “No one, no one should be shot and killed for attending a protest. No one should have to put their life at risk just for expressing their views,” he said. “Now we have the second American citizen killed at the hands of Israeli security forces. It’s not acceptable. It has to change. And we’ll be making that clear to the senior-most members of the Israeli government.” Blinken added that the United States had “long seen” reports of Israeli forces ignoring extremist settler violence against Palestinians and reports of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians. Violence from the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has spilled into theoccupied West Bankin recent months. In recent months, the US has unveiled aseries of sanctionstargeting Israel settler violence against Palestinians. The IDF began a major raid in multiple parts of the territorylast month, bulldozing highways and razing buildings in the process. OIn Tuesday, at least two Palestinians – a man and a woman – were killed during an Israeli military incursion in the city of Tulkarem, according to the Ministry of Health in Ramallah. Israeli troops and settlers have killed 692 Palestinians, including 158 children, in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians. The family of the 26-year-old activist saidthey were“deeply offended by the suggestion that her killing by a trained sniper was in any way unintentional,”reiterating callsto US leaders for an independent investigation into her death. Eygi, who was born in Turkey, was shot while taking part in a weekly protest against an Israeli settlement near the Palestinian village of Beita. All Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law. She was a recent graduate of the University of Washington, and had been volunteering with the same pro-Palestinian activist group asRachel Corrie, a US citizen killed in 2003 while attempting to stop an Israeli bulldozer from demolishing Palestinian homes in Gaza. Eygi’s family, who have previouslyblamedIsrael for her killing, said the findings of the Israeli inquiry were “wholly inadequate.” “This cannot be misconstrued as anything except a deliberate, targeted and precise attack by the military against an unarmed civilian,” the family said. The ISMalso dismissedIsrael’s “specious claim” that Eygi was unintentionally hit by IDF fire, describing the slain activist as “one of the hundreds of thousands of martyrs Israel has killed over decades of ethnic cleansing, displacement, and genocide.” “The military’s account of the events is blindly based on the accomplices’ version, which completely contradicts the testimonies of multiple eye witnesses, who the military did not even contact,” the group said in a statement on Tuesday. “All eyewitnesses said immediately following the killing that the scene where Aysenur was killed was completely quiet, and that there could have been no excuse to open fire, let alone directly hitting a woman peacefully standing in an olive grove.”\n",

            "Dubai’s super-sized skyline is already home to the world’s tallest skyscraper. Now, it is set to welcome the world’s second tallest, too. The Burj Azizi broke ground in January this year, but its exact height was not disclosed at the time as its developer awaited approval from Dubai authorities, including the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), which is involved in planning for “supertall” buildings. On Wednesday, however, real estate firm Azizi Developments announced that its skyscraper will tower over neighboring landmarks — all but one, that is — at a staggering 725 meters (2,379 feet) tall. “From the outset, we had plans for two designs — one for the initially approved height of 526 meters, and the other for the taller, now-approved 725 meters,” Mirwais Azizi, the founder and chairman of Azizi Developments, told CNN in a written statement. The developer kept its “options open for both scenarios” when it began preparatory works earlier this year. But with the green light given for the building’s more ambitious proposal, additional work to the foundations and piling is “well underway,” Azizi added. The 131-story skyscraper will feature apartments, an all-suite “seven-star” luxury hotel and a seven-floor “vertical” shopping mall. Located on Sheikh Zayed Road, in Dubai’s World Trade Center district, Burj Azizi will still stand almost 340 feet shorter than the 2,717-foot-tallBurj Khalifa, less than two miles away. But it will handily beat local competition for the city’s second-tallest title, exceeding the current holder, Marina 101 (1,394 feet). Once topped out, it will also exceed the world’s current second-tallest building, Malaysia’s 2,227-foot-tallMerdeka 118. The tower is anticipated to set several records, including the world’s highest hotel lobby (on level 11), the world’s highest nightclub (on level 126) and the world’s highest observation deck (on level 130), according to Azizi Developments. The developer also said the building will clinch the record for Dubai’s highest restaurant (meaning its 122nd-floor venue will be higher than the Burj Khalifa’s 122nd-floor restaurant,At.mosphere) and the city’s highest hotel room, on the tower’s 118th floor. In apress release, Azizi said investment in the project has surpassed 6 billion dirham ($1.6 billion). “My vision for Burj Azizi is to create a lasting legacy, a tribute to Dubai as a destination of choice for both residents and visitors and a monumental achievement in engineering,” said Azizi in the release. Dubai currently hasmore towersmeasuring over 300 meters (984 feet) than any other city worldwide, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. The city is no stranger tosuperlative structures. It boasts theworld’s highest infinity pool, theworld’s largest natural flower garden, andthe world’s largest picture frame, to name a few. There are many more under construction, too: The Franck Muller Aeternitas Tower hopes to claim the title of the world’stallest residential clock towerwhen it opens in 2027, andCiel Dubai Marina, scheduled for completion later this year, is expected to become the world’s tallest hotel. The Burj Binghatti Jacob & Co Residences, meanwhile, is set to become the world’s tallest residential structure (and Dubai’s third-tallest building) at 1,952 feet. Burj Azizi is slated for completion in 2028, with apartments expected to go on sale in February 2025.\n",

            "Manchester CitymanagerPep Guardiolasaid he is “happy” that a hearing into the club’smore than 100 alleged breachesof the Premier League’s financial rules will begin soon. The club was charged in February 2023 after a four-year investigation, with thePremier Leaguealleging that City failed to provide accurate financial information between the 2009-10 season and the 2017-18 season. The league also accuses City of failing to comply with UEFA’s financial fair play (FFP) regulations between 2013-14 and 2017-18 and failing to follow Premier League rules on profit and sustainability between 2015-16 and 2017-18. If found guilty, the club could face a points deduction, an unlimited fine, or even expulsion from the league entirely, according to thePremier League’s handbook. According to multiple media reports, the hearing is due to begin on Monday and is expected to last around 10 weeks. “I am happy that it starts on Monday,” Guardiola said in a press conference ahead of the Citizens’ game against Brentford on Saturday. “I know there will be more rumors and new specialists about the sentences will come up. We are going to see. I know what people are looking for, I know what they are expecting. “Everybody is innocent until guilt is proven,” he continued. “An independent panel will decide, and I’m looking forward to the decision.” The Premier League has faced criticism over how long it has taken for the hearing to begin. InMay 2023, Guardiola said: “What I would like is that the Premier League or the judges could make [a decision] as soon as possible. Then, if we did something wrong, everyone will know it. “Hopefully, they are not so busy and the judges can see it and listen to both sides and… decide what is the best, because in the end I know fairly what we won we won on the pitch because we deserve it,” he added. City Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak was also irked with the wait. “That’s very frustrating because it takes so much (away) from the great work that’s happening in this club and it’s happening not just on the football pitch,”he said in June 2023after the club won a historic treble earlier that year. Neither City nor the Premier League would comment on the hearing when contacted by CNN. Last month, Premier League CEO Richard Masters told theBBCthat it is “important the situation does resolve itself,” adding that it’s “self-evident the case needs to be heard.” In 2020, City was initially banned from European soccer for two seasons for “serious breaches” of FFP regulations. The ban was later overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which also reduced the accompanying $34 million fine to $11.3 million, ruling that City had failed to cooperate with UEFA. The hearing over the over 100 alleged charges is not the only dispute between City and the Premier League. The Times reported thatCity initiated legal actionin June 2024 over the league’s Associated Party Transaction rules, which require commercial and sponsorship deals involving companies owned by or associated with the same club’s owners to be independently assessed by the league.\n",

            "California’sLine Fireis burning so intensely that it created its own weather. Dramaticpyrocumulus, or “fire clouds,” exploded over the fire Monday at the exact time a high-resolution weather satellitehundreds of milesabove Earth’s surface was looking down at the planet. Pyrocumulus clouds form over intense heat sources, like raging wildfires or volcano eruptions. The air above such intense heat is quickly and chaotically forced to rise, which cools and condenses the air’s moisture, forming clouds. But pyrocumulus clouds also ingest large amounts of smoke and ash from the fires that form them, making these clouds a lot darker than a typical white, puffy cloud. That’s exactly what theLandsat-8 satellite, a joint data-gathering venture between NASA and the United States Geological Survey, saw on Monday. Massive pyrocumulus clouds bubbled up above the raging Line Fire, sending plenty of smoke and ash thousands of feet into the air. These clouds looked more like dirty cauliflower or used cotton balls on the satellite imagery compared to the puffy, white cumulus clouds to the east of the fire. The pyrocumulus clouds were also surrounded by smoke that appears light brown or tan-colored on the satellite image. Later in the day, the Line Fire’s pyrocumulus clouds eventually morphed into pyrocumulonimbus which produced lightning and rain,according to NASA. While rain from a storm like this may help firefighting efforts, the gusty thunderstorm winds and additional lightning strikes on dry areas could ignite new fires.\n",

            "Telegram founder Pavel Durov is under formal investigation and will not be allowed to leave France, a French prosecutor said in a statement released Wednesday night. The Russian-born billionaire is being investigated for several suspected offenses related to criminal activity on the platform, including complicity in illegal gang transactions, “laundering of crimes in an organized gang,” and refusal to communicate information to authorities, according to the French prosecutor’s statement. He must remain in the country under judicial supervision, with a bail set at $5.56 million (5 million euros), and is required to report to the French police station twice a week. Durov was released from police custody in France earlier in the day and transferred to court for questioning, prosecutors told CNN, days after his dramatic arrest at a Paris airport. The formal investigation announced Wednesday evening does not imply guilt in the French legal system, but indicates that prosecutors believe there is enough of a case to merit a serious official investigation. He has not yet been formally charged. Wednesday’s prosecutor’s office statement added that the French National Office for Minors has reported to the prosecutor’s office the “near absence of response” from Telegram to court requests concerning offenses that include trafficking, online hate speech, and pedophilia crimes. The suspected acts being probed include “complicity in the administration of a platform enabling an illegal transaction in an organized gang,” an offense that can carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Durov, 39, was detained at Paris’s Bourget Airport on Saturday on a warrant related to Telegram’s lack of moderation. He was being investigated on charges relating to a host of crimes, including allegations that his platform was complicit in aiding fraudsters, drug traffickers and people spreading child pornography. Telegram, and its lack of content moderation, has also come under scrutiny for its use by terrorist groups and far-right extremists. He was placed in custody for up to 96 hours, the maximum amount of time someone can be held under French law before being charged. Durov’s arrest started a row over freedom of speech, and caused particularconcerns in both Ukraine and Russia, where it is extremely popular and has become a key communication tool among military personnel and citizens during Moscow’s war on its neighbor. Russia criticized Paris on Wednesday for its detention of Durov. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said, “It seems to me that all this has once again demonstrated the true attitude of the French leadership, which has blatantly trampled on international norms in the field of ​​protecting freedom of speech and expression, for only one reason - because if they protect certain standards, they must not only comply with them, they must protect and implement them.” The Kremlin hassought to calm fearsin Russia about the future of the app, with Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov attempting to dispel calls for users to delete their sensitive messages on the app. French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said the decision to bring charges against Durov was “in no way political,” a rare intervention by a French leader into a judicial matter. Telegram was launched in 2013 by Durov and his brother, Nikolai. The app now has more than 950 million users, according to a post from Durov last month, making it one of the most widely used messaging platforms in the world. Conversations on the app are encrypted, meaning that law enforcement agencies – and Telegram itself – have little oversight on what users post. Durov was born in the Soviet Union in 1984, and in his 20s became colloquially known as the “Mark Zuckerberg of Russia.” He left the country in 2014 and now lives in Dubai, where Telegram is headquartered, while also holding French citizenship. He is worth an estimated $9.15 billion,according to Bloomberg, and has maintained a lavish, globe-trotting lifestyle over the past decade. But while his app has won plaudits from free speech groups and enabled private communication in countries with restrictive regimes, critics say it has become a safe haven for people coordinating illicit activities - including the terrorists who planned the Paris terror attacksin November 2015. “You cannot make it safe against criminals and open for governments,” Durov told CNN in 2016. “It’s either secure or not secure.” Reporting contributed by CNN’s Emmanuel Miculita and Antonella Francini in Paris.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/12/style/why-friday-13-unlucky-explained/index.html\n",
            "http status: 200\n",
            "When it comes to bad luck, there are few superstitions as pervasive in Western culture as that of Friday the 13th. Like crossing paths with a black cat and breaking a mirror, the notion of a day that can bring misfortune is deeply embedded — even if believers can’t quite explain why. There’s even a name to describe the irrational dread of the date: paraskevidekatriaphobia — a specialized form of triskaidekaphobia, a fear of the number 13. While Friday the 13th may feel like a rare phenomenon, our Gregorian calendar means that the 13th of any month is slightly more likely to fall on a Friday than any other day of the week. It is not, however, a universal superstition: In Greece and Spanish-speaking countries, it is Tuesday the 13th that is considered a day of bad luck, while in Italy, it is Friday the 17th that is met with fear. This month, however, there is only one in the calendar: Friday, the 13th of September. Like many superstitions that have evolved over time and across cultures, it is difficult to pinpoint the precise origins of Friday 13th. What we do know, though, is that both Friday and the number 13 have been regarded as unlucky in certain cultures throughout history. In his book “Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things,” Charles Panati traces the concept of the cursed back to Norse mythology, when Loki, the god of mischief, gate-crashed a banquet in Valhalla, bringing the number of gods in attendance to 13. Deceived by Loki, the blind god Hodr was tricked  into shooting his brother Balder, the god of light, joy and goodness, with a mistletoe-tipped arrow, killing him instantly. From Scandinavia, Panati explains, the superstition then spread south throughout Europe, becoming well established along the Mediterranean by the start of the Christian era. It was here that the unsettling power of the numerals was cemented  through the story of the Last Supper, which was attended by Jesus Christ and his disciples on Maundy Thursday. The 13th and most infamous guest to arrive, Judas Iscariot, was the disciple who betrayed Jesus, leading to his crucifixion on Good Friday. In Biblical tradition, the concept of unlucky Fridays, stretches back even further than the crucifixion: Friday is said to be the day that Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge; the day Cain murdered his brother, Abel; the day the Temple of Solomon was toppled; and the day Noah’s ark set sail in the Great Flood. It wasn’t until the 19th century, however, that Friday 13th became synonymous  with misfortune: As Steve Roud explains in “The Penguin Guide to the Superstitions of Britain and Ireland,” the combination of Friday and the number 13 is a Victorian invention. In 1907, the publication of Thomas W. Lawson’s popular novel “Friday, the Thirteenth” captured the imagination with its tale of an unscrupulous broker who took advantage of the superstitions around the date to deliberately crash the stock market. Fast forward to the 1980s, and a hockey-masked killer by the name of Jason Voorhees in the slasher flick franchise “Friday the 13th” ensured notoriety. Then came Dan Brown’s 2003 novel “The Da Vinci Code,” which helped popularize  the incorrect claim that the superstition originated with the arrests of hundreds of members of the Knights Templar on Friday, October 13, 1307. Given the mass of doom-laden lore, you’d be forgiven for thinking that Friday 13th is indeed ominous. If we dig deeper, though, we also find evidence that both Fridays and the number 13 have long been regarded as a harbinger of good fortune. In pagan times, for instance, Friday was believed to have a unique association with the divine feminine. The first clue can actually be found in the weekday name Friday, which is derived  from Old English and means “day of Frigg.” Both Queen of Asgard and a powerful sky goddess in Norse mythology, Frigg (also known as Frigga) was associated with love, marriage and motherhood. Frigg gave protection to homes and families, maintained social order, and could weave fate as she did the clouds. She also possessed the art of prophecy, and could bestow or remove fertility. On the other hand, Freyja, the goddess of love, fertility and war with whom Frigg was often conflated, was endowed with the power to perform magic, predict the future, and determine who would die in battles, and was said to ride a chariot pulled by two black cats. These goddesses were worshiped widely across Europe and, because of these associations, Friday was considered a lucky day for marriage by Norse and Teutonic people. The number 13, meanwhile, has long been regarded  as a portentous number by pre-Christian and goddess-worshipping cultures for its link to the number of lunar and menstrual cycles that occur in a calendar year. Fertility was prized in pagan times, and artwork would often draw connections to menstruation, fertility and the phases of the moon. Take the Venus of Laussel, an approximately 25,000-year-old limestone carving depicting a voluptuous female figure cradling her pregnant stomach with one hand, and holding a crescent-shaped horn bearing 13 notches in the other. Many scholars believe the figurine may have represented a goddess of fertility in a ritual or ceremony, while the 13 lines are typically read as a reference to the lunar or menstrual cycle, both of which symbolize feminine power. As Christianity gained momentum in the Middle Ages, however, paganism stood at odds with the new patriarchal faith. Not only did its leaders take objection to the worship of multiple gods and goddesses, but the celebration of Friday, the number 13, and the goddesses who invoked love, sex, fertility, magic and pleasure were deemed unholy. So revered were these deities, though, that making people relinquish them proved a real challenge. But Christian authorities persisted with their campaign, branding both the deities and the women who worshiped them witches. “When Norse and Germanic tribes converted to Christianity, Frigga was banished in shame to a mountaintop and labeled a witch,” Panati writes. “It was believed that every Friday, the spiteful goddess convened a meeting with eleven other witches, plus the devil — a gathering of thirteen — and plotted ill turns of fate for the coming week.” These days, of course, Friday the 13th still haunts the Western imagination. But with conversations around the role misogyny has played in silencing powerful women throughout history now in the mainstream, perhaps the narrative of this unlucky date and the female deities associated with it might soon be rewritten. The tide may have already started to turn: Take Taylor Swift, who considers 13 her lucky number and, early in her career, often performed with the number written on her hand. “I was born on the 13th. I turned 13 on Friday the 13th. My first album went gold in 13 weeks. My first No. 1 one song had a 13-second intro,” shetold MTVin 2009. “Every time I’ve won an award I’ve been seated in either the 13th seat, the 13th row, the 13th section or row M, which is the 13th letter. Basically, whenever a 13 comes up in my life, it’s a good thing.” With more endorsements like this, fortune, rather than fear, might well become the legacy of Friday the 13th.\n",

            "Years afterward, Iga Olszak often thought about the moment she first spotted Vlad Dimovski, on the sandy shores of Skotina, in Greece. Iga was 16, Vlad was 18. He was laughing with friends. Then pushed his long hair out of his eyes, met Iga’s eye, and smiled. “I remember feeling very excited about him,” Iga tellsCNN Traveltoday. Iga first saw Vlad in the summer of 2005. She was on vacation from Poland, at a summer camp in Greece. Vlad visited Skotina every summer from his home in what is now North Macedonia. The beach, in the foothills of Mount Olympus, was a home away from home for Vlad and he was always surrounded by a gang of friends. While Iga was intrigued by Vlad, she was “also kind of reserved.” For the first few days, they circled each other, but didn’t talk. Then, one evening Iga was sitting on the beach in a circle with her camp friends, while Vlad was sitting close by, in a separate circle, with his group. “At some point we all started sitting together,” recalls Iga. “Then Vlad came up to me so he could talk to me, and we sat next to each other on the beach, chatting, having a conversation. And it went from there.” Vlad noticed Iga right away, too. He had “so many good memories” of summers relaxing at Skotina beach. He knew all the regulars, and Iga stood out. He remembers the way she walked down the beach, recalls noticing her immediately, wanting to talk to her. Once they did speak, Iga and Vlad quickly became inseparable. “Every day we spent time together,” Iga recalls. “On the beach, or going hiking, chatting…” The two communicated in English – a little tricky as Iga wasn’t as confident in the language as Vlad. “But Vlad was helping me with certain words so we could communicate better,” says Iga. Iga and Vlad spent the next two weeks in each other’s company. Looking back, Iga’s overwhelming memory of their time together was “feeling very safe.” She found Vlad to be kind, respectful, funny. She wasn’t exactly in love – they were technically just friends – but she had a pretty heady crush. Vlad felt the same way. He describes their connection as “a friendship, but also a willingness to be together.” He felt like they were drawn to each other. But both Vlad and Iga were realistic that this connection might not last. “We had a really great time,” says Iga. “But I was still in high school. We lived very different lives in terms of being in different countries. There was no way for us to have a future. So that’s also what I remember feeling – feeling like it was exciting, but also knowing there was an end to it.” This end rolled around all too quickly. Iga and Vlad said their goodbyes when the camp came to an end. Social media was still in its early days in 2005, but the two exchanged email addresses. Back home in Poland, Iga classified Vlad in her head as “just a friend.” “But even my mom remembers how excited I was when I got his first email,” says Iga. “We kept that conversation going for the next two years.” Over that period, Iga and Vlad wrote back and forth about their thoughts on family, friends, travel, their studies, their hopes and dreams. “Both of us were having our own lives, but we just felt connected,” says Iga. “We exchanged probably over 100 emails.” “I couldn’t wait to receive an email from her,” says Vlad. “They meant a lot to me.” The two found other ways to stay connected, including chatting via instant messenger. “We’d download songs and listen to the album at the same time,” recalls Vlad. “Then we’d sit all night, talking about the songs for hours.” In time, Vlad realized he was talking more to Iga than any of his other summer friends – really more than anyone in his day-to-day life. Iga had a similar realization. “We spent a lot of time chatting and writing emails. We sent each other pictures of what’s going on in our lives,” recalls Iga, who found herself often looking back at photos they’d taken together that summer, posing together. Occasionally, Iga and Vlad would float the idea of meeting up again, but no concrete plans ever materialized. And in time both Iga and Vlad entered relationships with other people. “After that, I felt like, ‘I cannot really meet up with you, because I have a boyfriend,’” recalls Iga. “It felt like a great friendship, and I really wanted to meet him again – but I felt stuck in that I couldn’t do it, really.” As their respective romances got more serious, the emails gradually died off. “At some point, we just stopped having contact,” says Iga. But Vlad never deleted his emails from Iga. He often thought of her fondly. Meanwhile, Iga always felt grateful for her friendship with Vlad, and sad that it had dwindled. When Facebook became omnipresent, the two connected there. They communicated sporadically – one time when they realized they just missed each other in Germany, another time Vlad posted a throwback photo to the summer in Greece – but it was intermittent and surface level. “Losing touch was natural,” Vlad reflects today. “It comes with the distance.” Time moved on. Iga went to college, graduated and relocated from Poland to Germany. She got married, and then divorced within a year. It was a tough period. Meanwhile Vlad’s work took him to the US, and he moved there permanently in 2015. Vlad saw the move as a new start following a recent break-up. “I promised myself, when I go to the US, I won’t get into a relationship for at least a year,” he recalls. Vlad had only been living and working in Chicago for a month or so, when, out of the blue, a message popped up on his phone. It was from Iga. She was transiting through the Republic of Macedonia (which changed its name to North Macedonia after a 2019 referendum) and had a layover in the airport, not far from Vlad’s hometown. She’d dropped him a message, on the off chance he might be around and interested in a catchup, 10 years on. But Vlad was on the other side of the world, in the US. When he saw Iga’s message he went from excitement to disappointment in the space of a few minutes, surprising himself by how sad he felt to miss Iga. Vlad’s reply – explaining he’d moved to the US, saying how he wished he could have seen Iga – started a back and forth between the old friends on Facebook messenger. The messages – just like their teenage emails – went deep quickly. Iga and Vlad started talking every day, catching each other up on their lives, filling in the blanks over the past decade. “It got really intense quickly,” says Iga. “I felt like I was reconnecting with my best friend, with someone very dear to me.” “It was so nice and refreshing to talk to Iga,” says Vlad. Iga talked about her divorce, and Vlad mentioned he was also single. They felt connected to each other – just like they had when they were young, although neither necessarily assumed their connection had romantic potential. But when, in early 2016, Vlad mentioned he was planning a trip back to Europe, to visit family, the idea he might stop by to see Iga in Germany almost went without saying. “The day that he was coming to see me, it was very, very, very exciting,” says Iga. “I remember making banana pancakes for him. I woke up at five. I wanted to make him breakfast because he traveled overnight.” Pancakes prepared, Iga drove to the airport to meet Vlad. “The moment I saw him again was probably the best day of my life,” says Iga. “The emotion was really, really intense. It was even better than I imagined.” Vlad recalls being overwhelmed by how surreal it was – and yet it also just felt right. “She looked amazing,” he recalls. He knew what Iga looked like, he’d seen photos, but he realized he’d forgotten what it was actually like to be in her presence. Plus, they’d both grown up. They were in their late 20s. They both were – and weren’t – the same people they’d been a decade before. Iga showed Vlad around her city, Bielefeld, in northwest Germany. “It was a lot of talking,” says Vlad. “We had a great time. You could see there was something going on. It was a short period of time to understand if we’re meant for each other, or if we want to build a relationship. But it felt good.” While Vlad and Iga were together in Germany, they talked about the potential of Iga visiting Vlad in the US. A few weeks later, they connected on a video call to talk about this plan, and discuss where things stood between them. Iga initiated the conversation. “I knew I’d fallen in love with Vlad,” she says. “I knew I wanted to be with him, but he was more reserved. So I just felt like I needed to know, ‘Where do we stand?’” As someone who’d gone through a divorce, good communication was important to Iga. “I felt a lot of shame about what had happened to me,” she says. She’d opened up to Vlad about her previous relationship, and he’d been understanding and supportive. “He created that space for me where it felt really good and I finally felt okay to say the truth,” she says. It was one of the many reasons Iga had fallen in love with him. The thought he might not feel the same way was heartbreaking. But Vlad assured her that wasn’t the case – not remotely. “I was just really scared to get hurt,” says Vlad today. He was concerned about the realities of maintaining a long-distance relationship. “I wanted to be with Iga. But I was trying to live in the moment,” Vlad explains. He was worried labeling things, moving too quickly, could derail matters. But when Iga voiced her concerns, Vlad assured Iga he loved her too, and said he also wanted to try to make their connection work. So Iga booked her plane ticket to visit Vlad in Chicago a couple of months later. That visit was a turning point. “At that point, we were very serious,” Iga says. In May 2016, Iga took the plunge and moved to the US on a more permanent basis. She told herself that if it didn’t work out, she could always go back to Europe. But she and Vlad wanted to give their romance a proper try, so Iga applied for a work visa that would allow her to live in the US full time. Iga’s parents were encouraging. Her mother remembered how happy teenage Iga was whenever she received Vlad’s emails. ​”I had full support from my parents, and they were very excited for me,” says Iga. “But my brother was very anxious, like, ‘Oh my god, you met him on the internet.’” Iga told her brother that wasn’t strictly true – she’d known Vlad since she was 16. But she appreciated moving to the other side of the world to be with him was a big step. “The first six months we were just kind of learning how it feels to be together and to have that life together,” says Iga. “It was definitely a tricky position. We are both from different countries, and left our countries to live in a separate country.” “And I’d never lived with anybody in my life other than my family,” adds Vlad. “I’d never had roommates, never lived with a girlfriend in a shared flat. I’d always lived on my own. It was definitely an adjustment.” Iga and Vlad only grew more sure they were meant to be as the months rolled on. “We developed a great, stable and strong relationship,” says Iga. “We needed to depend on each other. We just had each other in our lives in the US. We didn’t have any family there, neither me nor Vlad, so we created that little spot together.” Iga started building the foundations for a life coaching business. The couple relocated from Chicago to Florida, then regretted the decision and returned to the familiarity and comfort of Chicago. Somewhere in between, Iga discovered she was pregnant. Children were something both Iga and Vlad had hoped for and talked about early on, but Iga’s pregnancy was unexpected. It was a surprise – but a good one. Midway through Iga’s pregnancy, Vlad’s beloved grandmother passed away, and he had to fly back to North Macedonia. As he waited for his flight, Vlad sat at the airport reflecting on life, loss and love. His grandparents had shared a great romance, one he always hoped to emulate. “They were an example of true love to me,” says Vlad. Vlad knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Iga. He thought about their first meeting on the beach in Greece. An idea started to develop. “I wanted to propose in Greece,” he says. He called a friend and asked to borrow their car, explaining he had a plan brewing. The friend offered to drive Vlad to Skotina beach. “So me, my friend, his girlfriend and my brother, we drove over there,” says Vlad. “It was September, out of season. I went to the spot where Iga and I met, and I recorded a video.” In the video, Vlad spoke directly to the camera, recounting meeting Iga when they were teenagers. How it felt to reunite a decade later. How much she meant to him. His excitement at their upcoming child. His hopes for their future. “Then I wrote, on the sand, the words: ‘Will you marry me?’” recalls Vlad. Later on, back in the US, Vlad took Iga for dinner, requesting a private table at the restaurant. Then, he took out his phone, loaded up the Greece video and pressed play. Iga was moved to see the beach again, touched by Vlad’s words on the screen, but she had no idea where it was going. “Then, at the end, I see the beach, where he’s written: ‘Will you marry me?’” recalls Iga. “I just started crying. Then he gave me the ring.’” Vlad had also written Iga a letter – he’d been inspired by his time at home, and recollections of his grandfather “who always wrote letters and notes about how he felt.” In Vlad’s letter to Iga, he described how important she was to him and how it felt to visit the beach where they met, all these years later. Some of the things he wrote down he’d never really said to her before – how he’d felt the moment he first saw her. The way he remembered her walking along the sand. How he’d saved all their emails. “It was so beautiful and romantic,” says Iga. “And then this beautiful video on the beach, when Greece is so symbolic to us…” Iga and Vlad welcomed their son, Luca, in 2018. The couple got married a month later – a small ceremony, with only their close family in attendance – and welcomed a second child, daughter Klara, a year later. Today, Iga and Vlad still live in the US, where they’re raising their kids with an international outlook. Iga runs alife coaching businessand works as a project manager for a tech company, while Vlad’s now the director of operations for a freight brokerage. The couple are pretty established in Chicago, but they still regularly visit Europe. “It’s very important for us as a family to maintain those relationships with our family,” says Iga. “Even though we are so far away, we still want our kids to know what Poland is, to know what Macedonia is, to know Europe.” This past summer, Iga and Vlad returned to Greece together, taking the kids to the beach where they met for the first time. The couple have a favorite photo from summer 2005, of the two of them standing by a blue door. Iga’s joking around, pouting, while Vlad’s gazing at her. “It’s an important photo,” says Iga. This summer, the couple recreated the picture, 19 years later – with the help of one of Vlad’s longtime friends, who was there when they met. The group found themselves all reminiscing on that summer. “You cried when she left,” said the friend to Vlad. Iga raised her eyebrows at her husband – he’d never admitted that before. Then, Iga and Vlad posed in the same spot, by the blue door, with their two kids in tow. “It was really special,” says Iga. Iga and Vlad also marked the moment by getting matching tattoos to symbolize their meeting, depicting the ocean waves and nearby Mount Olympus. Iga’s tattoo is on her left arm, Vlad’s on his right. They might lose their wedding rings, or forget to wear them, but the couple figured these tattoos would last forever, always symbolizing their love. Iga says the summer in Greece was very meaningful. “I saw the mountain, and right away I just felt very emotional, because this is the spot where I met Vlad,” she says. She enjoyed being there with their friends, treasured the time with their kids, but she tells Vlad today she also had the urge “just to lay down on the beach with you, and have you only for me.” It was strange, Iga says, to reflect that she wasn’t a teenager anymore, enjoying a summer crush. Life had moved on, turned into something she could never have anticipated, yet is so grateful for. “I think my younger self would be very proud and happy,” Iga reflects. “I had a different life in between. I had another marriage. And sometimes I would kind of regret things. But you cannot regret anything, it had to happen for you then to find yourself in this situation. Everything in my life brought me to this moment.” Today, Iga and Vlad both feel like everything happened the way it was supposed to, in the end. “I’m not usually a believer in those things,” says Vlad. “But with everything we’ve been through, and then everything leading back to each other – I cannot believe it was not meant to be.” “Our story is, for us, a foundation,” says Iga. “I believe that even if we get into crazy fights or misunderstandings or whatever is going to happen in our life, we are always going to remember where we came from, what we have built, and why it’s so important.”\n",

            "When Joan Chelimo first metRebecca Cheptegei, she remembers her fellow distance runner simply as a “normal, happy girl,” delighted to be competing at theOlympics. The pair had started talking after competing in the women’s marathon in Paris last month, Chelimo representing Romania and Cheptegei running for Uganda. “We had these chats after the race, and she was just so kind,” Chelimo tellsCNN Sport. “You could see she’s hardworking. “And to be honest, I could not see any sign – you couldn’t tell from how she was speaking – that she was going through something. And that makes me so sad.” Weeks after the Olympic marathon, Cheptegei died aged 33, succumbing to burns caused by her boyfriend, Dickson Ndiema, during an attack at her home in Kenya. Trans Nzoia County police said that Cheptegei had been doused in petrol by Ndiema, who stormed her house with a jerry can of gasoline and set her on fire after a disagreement over land. Ndiema has also died having sustained burns during the attack. “I don’t know where the humanity is,” says Chelimo. “I feel like something more has to be done. We need to come together as one voice, not only women but also men. Everybody in society and the community just needs to come together and see how we can end this. “I’ve been very sad. I could not sleep some of the nights. It’s been just terrible.” In the aftermath of the tragedy, Chelimo says that she visited Cheptegei’s home to see the site of the attack and learn from the late athlete’s children, who are aged 11 and nine, the horrific details surrounding their mother’s death. Chelimo was told about how Cheptegei tried to extinguish the flames engulfing her body by rubbing against a tree and rolling on the grass, desperate to try anything to stop the burning. “You could see from the green grass that there were some patches that had been really burnt, there was no grass,” she says. “That is the moment that I said to myself, ‘I’m going to work for justice. I don’t want this to happen again.’” Chelimo is a board member forTirop’s Angels, an organization formed by athletes following the 2021 killing of Kenyan distance runner Agnes Tirop, whose husband, Ibrahim Rotich, has been charged with her murder. Rotich has pleaded not guilty, according to Reuters, and the case is ongoing. Tirop’s Angels aims to combat gender-based violence in Africa and around the world. Among its objectives are empowering women and girls at risk of violence, expanding services available to survivors, intensifying efforts to turn policy pledges into reality, and engaging men and boys in prevention efforts. The organization also holds fundraising events – including marathons and half marathons – to promote awareness of gender-based violence and celebrate the lives of victims. On Friday, a day before Cheptegei’s funeral in eastern Uganda, Tirop’s Angels hosted a femicide walk in the Kenyan city of Eldoret. There have been plenty of challenges along the way for those involved in Tirop’s Angels, particularly in the early days. “The first time we started Tirop’s Angels, we had a lot of rejection,” says Chelimo. “We were not accepted from the community because people viewed us as, ‘Those are just girls who are against marriages, they want to separate people.’ That was the reception. But when we started incorporating men in our activities was when we were accepted.” In Kenya,according to government data from 2022,more than a quarter of men, and a third of women aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical violence, “committed by a husband/wife, intimate partner or anyone else.” The survey also shows that “marital status is linked to experiences of violence among women … women who have ever been married are much more likely to have experienced violence since age 15 than those who have never been married (41% versus 20%).” According to Chelimo, the issue of violence towards women in the region is born out of archaic ideas surrounding gender roles, and female international athletes are often targeted due to their financial success. “(These women) are going against traditional norms where the woman was just in the kitchen and taking care of the kids,” she says, adding: “Women athletes nowadays have traveled, and they know their rights and they want to come out and speak up. “They are becoming more independent, financially independent, and when they want to divorce, they can.” Months after Tirop’s death aged 25, another Kenyan athlete, 28-year-old Damaris Mutua, was found strangled in a homewith a pillow over her face. Mutua hadplaced third at a half marathon in Angolaearlier that month. Having represented Uganda at international races for several years, Cheptegei was competing at the Olympics for the first time in Paris, finishing 44th in the marathon. Her mother, Agnes, remembered her as “a good child,” while her father, Joseph, blamed the Kenyan government and police for failing to prevent their daughter’s death, saying that the family had previously reported Ndiema for domestic violence offenses. Neither the Kenyan police nor Kenya’s Directorate of Criminal Investigations have responded to CNN’s request for comment. “She spoke up,” says Chelimo, “she told people around her, she reported it to the police. Nothing was done. So, the cry from the family was: ‘We just want justice; we just want more enforcement from the government.’” When she speaks, Chelimo does so with a heavy heart. She laments the pain caused to Cheptegei’s children – “the scars that they are left with” – and wants better protection systems in place to protect future generations of women. “I’m not running just to make money,” she says. “I’m running for all the girls out there who are looking to me, who are going through whatever they’re going through. “That’s what I said to myself: ‘I am my sister’s keeper.’”\n",

            "Award-winning Nigerian singer Adekunle Gold rose to international fame when his debut album “Gold” reached number seven on the Billboard World Charts. Since then, the 37-year-old has released four more albums, amassing hundreds of millions of streams worldwide. Behind the scenes, however, he has been quietly battlingsickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that leads to abnormally shaped red blood cells, causing severe pain, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications. It affects children who inherit two copies of the sickle cell gene, one from each parent. The disease is most prevalent in Africa, which accounts for66% of cases worldwide,according to the World Health Organization. Nigeria bears the highest burden, whereas many as 150,000 babiesare born with sickle cell disease annually – the most of any country. Adekunle Gold first wrote of his woes with sickle cell disease in 2022 in his song “5 Star.” Now, he is readying himself for a long-term commitment to advocacy, announcing the establishment of the Adekunle Gold Foundation, which will focus on addressing the needs of children battling sickle cell disease on the African continent. Recently, the singer sat down with CNN’s Larry Madowo for his first in-depth interview about living with sickle cell. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Larry Madowo: Why are you speaking up aboutsicklecell disease now and especially being very aggressive about this awareness? Adekunle Gold:I just really got the courage to come out and speak about it. You know, a lot of people can’t share their stories like I can. I was writing the song “5 Star” and reflecting on my life, the journey, and how I’m a miracle. I was reflecting on that song, and I thought, maybe it’s time to learn my voice. People are dying, people are going through it. People can’t afford basic things that they need to sustain their health, and if the international organizations are not doing anything about it, it’s time to force their hands to do it. Larry Madowo: What challenges have you had to overcome while living withsicklecell? Adekunle Gold:I constantly put myself in situations that made me sick as a child. For example, doing strenuous activities as a child that I was not supposed to do and there were always consequences, you know? But I always knew that I didn’t want this thing to define me. So, if it means that I need to exercise more, take my drugs, eat well, rest well, and take more water, then I need to do that always. Larry Madowo: Are there any memorable things that you’ve come through during your advocacy work when people are not even aware of what they’re facing? Adekunle Gold:Just speaking up about it on social, I realized that a lot of people are ignorant about it. This is something that I inherited, and you’re trolling me for it. So, you realize people don’t even know these things. I just need more people to be aware. Larry Madowo: What are some of the barriers to receiving proper care forsickle cell patients in West Africa? In Nigeria? Adekunle Gold:Listen, people don’t have money, bro. The last outreach I did people came to Lagos to take drugs, to check their BP (blood pressure), to check their children all the way from Ilorin [300 kilometers away from Lagos]. And I’m like, this is insane. We don’t have facilities where you can just be in your place.Other countries like the UK and Canada have policies for sickle cell. Where it affects us the most, we don’t have (accessible care). People can’t afford to buy folic acid and folic acid is the smallest of things that you should be able to get. Larry Madowo: What do you hope to achieve by adding your voice to this, by speaking up publicly? Adekunle Gold:I want everybody to, first of all, be aware of it and know how to treat people that have it.  I also want people to understand that it is important to check your genotype. Larry Madowo:You’re the embodiment that you can livewith sicklecell and have a full, healthy, and powerful life. Will you keep talking about this in your music and your public appearances with your shows? Adekunle Gold:I started the foundation, so you know it’s real. It’s game time from now on. So, I am constantly learning my voice, constantly doing outreach, and constantly fighting for it. I want the international community to pay attention just like they do to other diseases. Sickle cell is a big one. It affects my people the most, and I want the world to do something about it. Watch Larry Madowo’s full interview with Adekunle Gold onAfrican Voices Changemakers.\n",

            "Malaysianauthorities on Wednesday rescued 402 children and arrested 171 suspects after raiding 20 welfare homes linked to an Islamic business group, in which children were exploited and sexually abused, the national police chief said. Inspector-General of Police Razarudin Husain said the raids were conducted after investigations into allegations of child abandonment, deviant teachings and sexual assault at the homes, run by the Global Ikhwan Services and Business Holdings. Some 201 boys and 201 girls, aged between 1 to 17 years, were rescued from 18 homes in central Selangor state and two in southern Negeri Sembilan state, he said. The 171 suspects — 66 men and 105 women — included religious teachers and caretakers, he said. Children were sexually abused not only by the caretakers but were also forced to do the same to each other at the facilities, Razarudin said in a televised news conference. “Those who were sick were not allowed to seek medical attention until their condition became critical,” he said. Some young children were also burnt with a hot spoon when they made mistakes, and caretakers had touched the children’s bodies as if to conduct medical checks, he said. Police believed that Global Ikhwan exploited the children and used religious sentiments to collect donations, he said. Investigations showed that the children at the welfare homes belonged to members of the Global Ikhwan group, placed by their parents at the homes since they were infants, he said. The children would undergo medical assessment amid ongoing investigations, he added. According to its website, Global Ikhwan was founded by Ashaari Mohamad, who headed the Islamic sect Al Arqam which was deemed heretical and banned by the government in 1994. It said the group had undergone a series of rebranding since Ashaari died in 2010. The group recently also came under the radar of Islamic authorities amid claims that it was still involved with the deviant teachings of the Al-Arqam sect. Global Ikhwan, in a statement Wednesday, denied allegations that it exploited children and said that it would cooperate with authorities. But it made no mention of allegations of sexual abuse against them. “The company will not compromise with any activity that goes against the law, particularly regarding the exploitation of children as workers,” the statement said. Global Ikhwan’s website said it is involved in a wide range of businesses including food and beverage, media, medical, travel and property. It employs more than 5,000 people and has branches in 20 countries including a chain of restaurants in London, Paris, Australia and Dubai among others.\n",

            "http status: 200\n",
            "How many modern-day pop stars are taking makeup cues from the 15th century? At least one. The 26-year-old musician, Chappell Roan, made her hotly-anticipated VMA debut last night — arriving on the red carpet in a sheer Y/Project dress, thigh-high knight boots and a face painted like a spectral Renaissance woman. Later during her performance, Roan switched centuries — morphing into a camp version of the medieval feminist icon Joan of Arc. “If Joan of Arc was a glamour girl,” quipped Roan’s makeup artist, Andrew Dahling, who worked on the VMA vision. Roan — who won Best New Artist — sang her chart-topping hit “Good Luck, Babe!” in a full chain-mail knight’s suit in front of a flaming castle, her auburn locks styled into two back-length braids. The sense of historical accuracy in her costume came to an abrupt stop, however, above the neck. Roan’s plaster-white face was delicately blushed mauve at the cheeks with her brows blocked out in favor of two pencil-thin lines. A theatrical smokey eye, made up of iridescent blue, purple and gold eyeshadow, was blended right up to her brow bone. Dahling was inspired by Pat McGrath’s work as runway makeup artist for Dior in the 2000s. “It’s very romantic,” he told CNN in a video call from New York in the days leading up to the awards show. “But sort of dark romantic… Very heavy on the eyes, very glowy skin, very ethereal… (Each look is) all in this medieval Renaissance realm.” For Roan’s red carpet look, Dahling had a lighter touch. The singer’s chalky complexion was soft and blurred, while her eyes were enlarged by a rim of white liner and finished with a delicate dab of gold. Dahling wanted to reference the plump, peachy faces of the women immortalized in Renaissance and Baroque oil paintings. “I love pulling (inspiration) from artists and painters,” he said. “Because I feel like their perspective captures something a little bit different than what a makeup artist would do.” Roan’s meteoric rise can, at least in part, be attributed to her inexhaustible commitment to transforming into different characters. In the last four months, she has performed dressed as aNFL-player completewith rhinestoned shoulder pads and “eye black” stripes at Hangout Festival in Alabama, a latex-cladWWE wrestler at Lollapaloozain Chicago and asage-green, joint-smoking Lady Libertyat the Governors Ball in New York. (Dahling, who was behind Roan’s green body paint and makeup, said the look took around four hours to complete). Although she is almost never without her trademark powder white face —a ghostly base that would even make Queen Elizabeth jealous. Ahead of the Europe and UK legs of her tour in later this month, Roaneven posteda series of themes and corresponding moodboards instructing fans on how to dress for her shows: From mermaids at the Manchester show to camo for Glasgow and London. “She has such a strong vision,” said Dahling. “And this larger-than-life superstar version of herself that she wants to put out.” With her makeup, creativity is king while the conventional, social media-ready glam that has become to define modern beauty standards often takes a backseat. “It’s not meant to look classically beautiful (like) the Instagram makeup that we see today that’s super blended and perfect,” said Dahling of Roan’s VMAs vision. “Nothing like that.” The pop star calls herself a “drag artist”— a term typically reserved for male performers using makeup to create and embody extravagant, theatrical female characters. Despite being a woman, Roan often paints her face with direct references to renowned queens such as Divine, the actor, performer and John Waters muse who inspired the look for her appearance atKentucky Pride. Violet Chachki, the winner of season seven of reality competition “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” was an inspiration for Coachella, too. “Violet Chachki has this black negative space, smoked out look she does,” said Davy. “I remember that was on one of the initial moodboards I received from Chappell’s stylist.” If the concept is confusing to some, it shouldn’t be, said Dahling. “Drag is such an umbrella term, especially now…I think anything is drag,” he told CNN. “Drag could honestly be a guy (working in the Financial District) putting on a really nice tux and going into the office, (embodying) this version of himself that he’s created.” “It’s about creating a new face,” said Davy. “You block out the brows, meaning you glue them down and then put concealer over them to make (them) a more exaggerated shape. It’s carving out the cheekbones. It’s doing an exaggerated lip shape, contouring the nose. Then it’s a big dramatic eye look… It’s about donning this character that you switch into… I don’t think it conforms to gender.” Dahling agrees. “There’s no rules,” he said. “It’s playful. It’s not like it has to be perfect… it’s very much a DIY feel.” Although he insists “the messier the better,” Dahling does have one non-negotiable for any fans looking to recreate Roan’s look: mastering her now-iconic Venetian white foundation. “No patchiness with the base,” he laughs. “The base has to be good.”\n",

            "A military court in Congo handed down death sentences Friday to 37 people, including three Americans, after convicting them on charges of taking part in a coup attempt. The defendants, who also included a Briton, Belgian, Canadian and several Congolese, can appeal the verdict on charges that included terrorism, murder and criminal association. Fourteen people were acquitted in the trial, which opened in June. Six people were killed during thebotched coup attemptled by the little-known opposition figure Christian Malanga in May that targeted the presidential palace and a close ally of PresidentFelix Tshisekedi. Malanga was fatally shot while resisting arrest soon after live-streaming the attack on his social media, the Congolese army said. Malanga’s 21-year-old son Marcel Malanga, who is a US citizen, and two other Americans were convicted in the the attack. His mother, Brittney Sawyer, has said her son is innocent and was simply following his father, who considered himself president of a shadow government in exile. The other Americans wereTyler Thompson Jr., who flew to Africa from Utah with the younger Malanga for what his family believed was a vacation, and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company. The company was set up in Mozambique in 2022, according to an official journal published by Mozambique’s government, and a report by the Africa Intelligence newsletter. Thompson’s family maintains he had no knowledge of the elder Malanga’s intentions, no plans for political activism and didn’t even plan to enter Congo. He and the Malangas were meant to travel only to South Africa and Eswatini, Thompson’s stepmother said. The reading out of the verdict and sentencing before the open-air military court were broadcast live on television. Last month, the military prosecutor, Lt. Col. Innocent Radjabu. called on the judges to sentence to death all of the defendants, except for one who suffers from “psychological problems.” Earlier this year, Congoreinstated the death penalty, lifting a more than two-decade-old moratorium, as authorities struggle to curb violence and militant attacks in the country.\n",

            "Russia had been planning to launch a new attack on Ukraine from the Kursk region before Kyiv’s surprise cross-border incursion, Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday. In his first television interview since becoming military chief in February, the general told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that he believed the Kursk operation had been a success. “It reduced the threat of an enemy offensive. We prevented them from acting. We moved the fighting to the enemy’s territory so that [the enemy] could feel what we feel every day,” Syrskyi said, in a rare interview that offered a candid assessment of the war. Last month, Ukrainian forces stormed into Kursk in a cross-border incursion that caught even American officials by surprise. It signaled that, despite Russia’s advantage in terms of men and armor, its military has vulnerabilities. In what is the most detailed explanation of the rationale behind the incursion, Syrskyi outlined the key objectives of the operation: to stop Russia from using Kursk as a launchpad for a new offensive, to divert Moscow’s forces from other areas, to create a security zone and prevent cross-border shelling of civilian objects, to take prisoners of war and to boost the morale of the Ukrainian troops and the nation overall. Speaking to Amanpour at an undisclosed location near the frontline, the general, who took over as army chief in February, said Moscow moved tens of thousands of troops to Kursk, including some of its best airborne assault troops. And while admitting that Ukraine was under immense pressure in the area around Pokrovsk, the strategic city that has for weeks been the epicenter of war in eastern Ukraine, Syrskyi said his troops have now managed to stall the Russian advances there. “Over the last six days the enemy hasn’t advanced a single meter in the Pokrovsk direction. In other words, our strategy is working.” he said. “We’ve taken away their ability to maneuver and to deploy their reinforcement forces from other directions … and this weakening has definitely been felt in other areas. We note the amount of artillery shelling as well as the intensity of the offensive have decreased,” he said. Speaking to Amanpour just after inspecting the frontlines on Thursday, Syrskyi said that there’s no doubt that Ukraine is outgunned and outmanned as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression. “The enemy does have an advantage in aviation, in missiles, in artillery, in the amount of ammunition they use, of course, in personnel, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles,” he said. But Syrskyi also said the fact that Russia has such a material advantage has forced Ukraine to become smarter and more efficient in the way it’s fighting the war. “We cannot fight in the same way as they do, so we must use, first of all, the most effective approach, use our forces and means with maximum use of terrain features, engineering structures and also, to use technical superiority,” he said, highlighting Ukraine’s advanced drone program and other home-grown high-tech weaponry. Syrskyi was named Ukraine’s commander in chief in February, after President Volodymyr Zelensky fired Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. He took over at a particularly difficult time for Ukraine. The months-long delays in the delivery of US military assistance caused critical ammunition shortages. At the same time, Ukraine was struggling to replenish its troops, exhausted and diminished after fighting Russia’s relentless offensive for two years. Syrskyi said recruiting more soldiers was a priority. The Ukrainian government then passed a controversial mobilization law, requiring all men between 18 and 60 to register with Ukraine’s military and to carry their registration documents on them at all times – an effort to make the recruitment process more transparent and fair. Seven months later, the new recruits are arriving to the frontlines. But several commanders have told CNN that not all of the new soldiers are ready to fight and are routinely abandoning their positions. Syrskyi admitted his troops are heading to the battlefield after receiving less training than he’d like them to. “Of course, everyone wants the level of training to be the best, so we train highly qualified professional military personnel,” he said. “At the same time, the dynamics at the front require us to put conscripted servicemen into service as soon as possible,” he added, explaining that new recruits get one month of basic military training followed by half a month to a full month of more specialized training before they are sent to fight. Syrskyi told Amanpour that the delays in US military assistance did cause major setbacks on the battlefield and led to a slump in morale – something he admitted was still an issue. He said he takes frequent trips to the frontlines and makes sure he spends time with his troops. “We speak the same language … we understand each other no matter who I am talking to – whether this is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander, or a battalion commander,” he said. “I have been in this war since 2014,” he said, referring to Russia’s incursion into the Donbas 10 years ago. “In other words, the frontline is my life. We understand each other, I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience,” he added. Syrskyi ended the candid interview by thanking Ukraine’s Western allies for their support. Switching from Ukrainian to English, he said: “Together we are stronger. Together we can win.”\n",

            "Over the past few days in New York City — and a little further afield, on Long Island — mainstay brands like Ralph Lauren, Coach, Tommy Hilfiger and Tory Burch looked to reinvigorate or redefine the classics, while labels including Alaïa and Off-White, who typically show in Paris, crossed the pond to define what American fashion means to them. New York Fashion Week, which formally kicks off fashion month, has found itself at a crossroads in recent seasons as its counterparts in Milan and Paris have maintained dominance on the industry’s schedule with sought-after shows and splashy celebrity guest lists. But that doesn’t mean the city has been without its A-listers — especially since the weeklong event has coincided with the US Open, bringing out plenty of stars to sit both by the court and the catwalk. Ralph Lauren got things started with an off-schedule Hamptons fête on Thursday, recreating its iconic Polo Bar for guests including First Lady Jill Biden, singer Usher, and actors Jude Law, Tom Hiddleston and Naomi Watts. At the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum the following night, Alaïa reunited supermodels Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Amber Valletta and Stephanie Seymour in the audience while Kendall Jenner led the models’ procession around the art museum’s famed spiraling architecture — though Rihanna’s glittering appearance in a crystal mesh ensemble by the French luxury house was the biggest surprise of the evening. Later in the week, Tory Burch drew an enviable front row that included Elizabeth Olsen, Michelle Williams, Jodie Turner-Smith, Mindy Kaling and Ella Emhoff, who watched on as aughts icon Alexa Chung walked the runway. And for the Brooklyn-based label Luar, who staged the final evening show, a surprise appearance by Madonna in latex gloves and a wide camel coat set off a frenzy of camera flashes. (Next to her, a final empty seat remained a mystery until the rapper Ice Spice arrived to claim it). Celebrities also turned out in droves for Off-White as creative director Ib Kamara headed the label’s first-ever New York runway on Sunday. Singers Zayn Malik, Mary J. Blige, Tinashe, Victoria Monét and Camila Cabello, supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio, and actors Issa Rae and Lena Waithe arrived at basketball courts along the Brooklyn waterfront to see the collection, “Duty Free,” which took inspiration from the late founder Virgil Abloh’s Ghanaian heritage. Also in attendance was US Olympic water poloist Ashleigh Johnson — with rapper Flavor Flav, of course, who became a sponsor of her team this year — and 2024 Olympic all-around gymnastics gold medalist Sunisa Lee. But Olympians haven’t just been on the guest list this week — they’ve made surprise runway debuts as well. Another one of the gymnastics “Golden Girls,” Jordan Chiles, traded the balance beam for the catwalk at Kim Shui, wearing a floral silk leotard-style outfit, finished with a fluttering cape, while sprinter Noah Lyles embraced a more leisurely pace at Willy Chavarria’s show in white athletic shorts and armbands emblazoned with “América,” the name the designer chose for a show about the immigrant perspective of the American Dream. Chavarria’s latest collection — which featured baggy, belted khakis; crisp ties and lapels; and utility menswear skirts, followed by a separate, new sportswear line with Adidas — was set against the backdrop of the American flag and began with a performance of the classic Spanish love song “Querida.” (Guests also received small booklets from the American Civil Liberties Union printed with the full US Constitution, a reminder of the country’s founding ideals.) It was far from the only show that expressed a sense of political urgency ahead of the 2024 election. Galvanized by Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, the Nepali American designer Prabal Gurung wrote in the show notes that he wanted create a collection that reflects “a powerful affirmation of matriarchy, femininity and the future.” Gurung’s collection of trailing neck scarves, sheer bustiers and hand-draped sari pants was full of movement on a breezy day near City Hall — and included a seemingly tongue-in-cheek reference to Harris with an embroideredcoconut treemini dress. “I’ve always believed in power of women, of feminine-leaning ideas,” Gurung told CNN just before the show. “I’ve always believed that they saved me… and I know they can save the world.” The surrealist label Area, celebrating its 10th anniversary, had a pointed message as well. Partnering with the dating app Tinder to promote (and donate to) the national abortion rights campaign Bans Off Our Bodies, Areashowing a collection of handprints and fingerprints printed, stitched and etched on the garments. “We really think about and reflect on what is going on in the world and put that back into our clothes,” creative director Piotrek Panszczyk told CNN backstage. Their lineup included a Tinder logo T-shirt, one of several highly visible partnerships of the week as companies jockeyed for branding within the collections. Designer Elena Velez was sponsored by the online platform OnlyFans for her show of reimagined mythologized heroes setting out for battle in platform boots, leather and pageantry sashes. Sandy Liang, collaborating with Android, sent out a Samsung Galaxy Z flip phone enclosed in a case with her signature star motif. (Pornhub also sponsored a show by the label Private Policy, though its logo did not appear in the line). The biggest collaborations, however, were the ones that produced a second collection. Like Chavarria with Adidas, designer Naeem Khan did double duty with a second line of looks. For Khan, his partner was Universal Pictures for the upcoming musical adaptation of “Wicked,” leading to glittering gowns in pink, green and black that models showcased to the film’s score. Kahn told CNN that he strove for cohesion between the two sets of intricate evening wear. “How do I say ‘Wicked’ in the chicest way possible? Because I cannot make it into costumes from the movie,” he said of the prompt. “It has to have my DNA.” Scroll down to see this season’s runway highlights, updated throughout the week.\n",

            "Floodwaters that gushed from an overflowing dam in northern Nigeria engulfed a zoo and swept animals including crocodiles and snakes into communities, as the region battles some of the worst flooding in years. In the northeastern Borno State – one of the areas hit hardest by floods in the region – officials at a state-run zoo said Tuesday that surging waters had killed “more than 80%” of wildlife at the facility and washed animals, including deadly reptiles, into neighborhoods. Avideoof an ostrich wading through a flooded road in the capital, Maiduguri, has been widely shared on social media. A spokesperson for NEMA, Nigeria’s disaster management agency, Manzo Ezekiel, told CNN Wednesday that efforts were being made to recapture the animals. “I believe the zoo managers are not resting. They will be doing their best to recover some of the animals that they can recover because the animals going out there will pose danger to the people,” he said. Swaths of Maiduguri remain flooded, after the Alau Dam, 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of the city, overflowed over the weekend, leaving entire houses submerged. The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) described the flooding asthe worstin Maiduguri in 30 years. Authorities have not confirmed any human deaths from the event, but more than 200 people have died in other floods across the country over the past few weeks. The UN agencysaidthat about 280,000 people are estimated to have been affected in Maiduguri and that around 200,000 others have been displaced in the city. Weeks of flooding across Nigeria have led to 229 deaths and displaced more than 386,000 people, according to the latest data from NEMA, shared with CNN. Northern Nigeria has been the most affected by the floods, the data showed. NEMAsaidone of the spillways of the Borno dam collapsed, “leading to a significant increase in water flow … and exacerbating the flooding in surrounding areas.” Its spokesperson, Ezekiel, told CNN that “the flood is very intense” and is “beyond what was forecasted.” “We didn’t envisage this volume of water rushing into the town,” he added.

            "American andChinesemilitary commanders spoke in a long-anticipated call Tuesday as the two powers seek to manage their intensifying rivalry in a contentious Asia-Pacific region – and repair lines ofmilitary communicationsevered more than two years ago. US Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Samuel Paparo and Gen. Wu Yanan, commander of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Southern Theater Command spoke via video conference, according to statements from both sides. The call marks a step forward in what has been a gradual restoration of high-level US-China military communications in recent months as the two sides navigate a host of regional tensions, including over Beijing’saggressions in the South China Seaand toward Taiwan. Beijingsevered high-level military-to-military communicationwith the US in August 2022 following visit bythen-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, the self-ruling democratic island that China’s ruling Communist Party claims as its own. China and the US agreed to hold the commander-level call “in the near future” during a visit fromWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivanto Beijing late last month. In Tuesday’s call, Paparo underscored that having sustained lines of communication between senior military leaders serves “to clarify intent and reduce the risk of misperception or miscalculation,” according to a White House readout. He also cited “several recent PLA unsafe interactions with US allies,” and called on the PLA to “comply with international laws and norms to ensure operational safety.” “Paparo also urged the PLA to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive, and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond,” said the readout, which characterized the talks as a “constructive and respectful exchange of views.” A readout published by Chinese state media Tuesday morning confirmed the talks and simply said the “two sides exchanged in-depth views on issues of common concern.” The resumption of the commander-level talks comes amid especially heightened tensions in the South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine ships have been engaged in a series of increasingly violent, but so-far non-lethal confrontations in recent months. Beijing claims the sea almost in its entirety despite amajor international rulingto the contrary, and the US has in recent months reiterated Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to defend its treaty ally, the Philippines. Analysts have long warned that a miscalculation in the South China Sea could quickly spiral into a damaging regional conflict between the world’s two largest economies and that a lack of communication could compound those risks. The talks also play out amid a range of frictions between Washington and Beijing, including overChina’s close ties to Russiaand what the US says is its support for Moscow’s defense industrial base, as well as Beijing’s concerns that the US is tightening ties with its regional allies to contain China. Tuesday’s call marks a rare point of contact between top military officials leading American troops in the Indo-Pacific and Chinese strategy in the Southern and Eastern theater respectively. It comes within a broader, gradual resumption of high-level military communication following ameetingbetween US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in November. Top US and Chinese generalsspoke in Decemberafter more than a year of silence, andUS and Chinese defense chiefsheld rare talks on the sidelines of a defense gathering in Singapore in May.

            "Egypt’s “New Administrative Capital,”a new city deep into construction outside Cairo, has prompted plenty of blue-sky thinking. But few ideas have been as ambitious as powering a skyscraper with hydrogen. The Forbes International Tower, a 240 meter (787 feet) tall office building due to be constructed close to the Iconic Tower —Africa’s tallest building— was planned from the outset to be environmentally conscious. Designed by Gordon Gill of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the firm behind Central Park Tower, New York, and the upcoming Jeddah Tower, Saudi Arabia, its developer Magnom Properties has now revealed it intends to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint by powering the 43-floor office building via clean hydrogen, supplemented by solar panels on its facade. Powered by75% hydrogen and 25% photovoltaics, the building would not rely on a traditional power grid, according to Magnom, its developer. Magnom said constructing with materials with “low-embodied carbon” — materials with reduced associated emissions via their sourcing, manufacture and eventual disposal or reuse — could cut the carbon footprint of its construction by 58%. Meanwhile, water recycling and treatment on site will reduce freshwater demand — vital inan increasingly water-scarce country. Through these methods, Magnom says it aims to achieve a “net-negative carbon vision” (removing more carbon than it emits) for the skyscraper over its lifecycle, and to become the first skyscraper in the world to register forZero Carbon Certificatefrom the International Living Future Institute. The buildingmarks the latest chapter in net-zero architecture, following the likes ofFoster + Partner’s Z6 tower in Beijing, which has net-zero operational emissions, and the upcomingCurzon Wharfin Birmingham, England, featuring a 565 foot tower as part of a large, net-zero carbon mixed-use development. Using hydrogen to reduce a building’s emissions is a novel approach, however. A potentially clean and renewable energy source —though only when sourced and produced through certain methods— hydrogen is an abundant asset little-utilized at this scale in architecture or by private enterprise. In recent years hydrogen has received significant attention from governments including the Biden administration, with US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm calling it the“Swiss army knife of zero-carbon technologies” in 2023. However, critics have questioned how quickly production can be ramped up to meet the energy demand currently met by fossil fuels. Magnom Properties has signed an agreement with Schneider Electric and H2 Enterprises to explore using LOHC technology as the skyscraper’s power source. LOHC —liquid organic hydrogen carriers— are organic compounds that absorb or release hydrogen through chemical reactions, and can be used to store manufactured hydrogen and transport it in a stable form from source to end user. Liquid hydrogen compounds also meanexisting fossil fuel transport infrastructurecould be adapted for re-use with the new technology. Once transported, the hydrogen can be stripped from the LOHC and placed in a fuel cell to produce electricity. The agreement, per Magnom, will assess the “design, space requirements and economic viability” of using clean hydrogen for the Forbes International Tower, meaning it’s not certain that hydrogen will be the eventual power source. Other architects are also wrestling with alternative power sources and transmission to meet the energy needs of high-density environments. Another giant of architecture, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), recently announced a partnership with energy storage company Energy Vault to develop a gravity power storage system within a megatall skyscraper. The design —which could reach 3,000 feet high— would utilize an electric motor to raise giant blocks up through the building during periods of low energy demand; then during periods of high demand the blocks would be lowered, powering a motor and converting the stored energy back into electricity. SOM is also exploring integrating pumped storage hydropower into buildings, using water instead of blocks (an approach already taken by some dams). However it sources its power, the Forbes International Tower will rise in the heart of the New Administrative Capital’s central business district, where domestic and international companies are already moving in. The smart city, a satellite of Cairo touted for its sustainable credentials, began construction in 2016. Though ongoing, many key buildings have now been completed for the project, which has beenestimated to cost around $58 billion.\n",

            "More than 560,000 children aged below 10 in Gaza have received the first of two doses of the polio vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday, after Israel’s destruction ofwaterand sanitation systems led to a resurgence of thedeadly diseasein the besieged strip. Aid workers reached more than 90% of targeted vaccine coverage in the first phase of the UN-led campaign, according to theUN’s agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA. The second set of vaccinations is scheduled to take place in four weeks, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs saidon Monday. “We admire all the health teams, who conducted this complex operation,” WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in apost on X. “We are deeply grateful to the families, for their trust and cooperation.” “This is a massive success amidst a tragic daily reality of life across the Gaza Strip. Imagine what could be achieved with a ceasefire,” he added. Israel’s offensive in Gaza, launched after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, has precipitated a humanitarian crisis and flattened critical infrastructure. About 70% of all water and sanitation facilities have been destroyed or damaged, the WASH Cluster, a United Nations-led group that coordinates humanitarian efforts for water, sanitation and hygiene, saidin July. Meanwhile, Israeli aid restrictions have severely depleted fuel stocks, chlorine and spare parts, stifling water production, purification and sewage pumping, according to the agency. The UN’s polio campaign, facilitated by a series of pauses in fighting agreed to by Israel, came after the highly infectious virus was found in sewage samples in the stripin June. Then in August, an 11-month old boy became the first person in Gaza in 25 years to be diagnosedwith polio. Polio mostly affects children under 5 years old and can cause irreversible paralysis and even death. It is highly infectious and there is no cure; it can only be prevented by immunization, according to the WHO. Relief workers describedrepeated challengesto the campaign rollout – especially in northern Gaza – citing Israelievacuation orders, roads damaged by bombardment, increased hostilities and scant fuel supplies. “There has been severe targeting and killings of Palestinians in the past few days by the Israeli military. It has been horrible,” Mahmoud Shalabi, a local aid worker in northern Gaza for the UK-based NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), told CNN in a statement on Tuesday. At least 25 staff from MAP have been deployed to support the UN-led campaign, by monitoring the rollout to ensure international protocols and standards are upheld, according tothe agency’s website. “It’s a dangerous place to work and live right now,” Shalabi said. “But I feel that the spirit of the people and the enthusiasm of healthcare staff here is going to make this campaign successful as much as possible.”\n",

            "South Korea has for decades been known as the world’s largest “baby exporter” – sending hundreds of thousands of children overseas after the country was ravaged by war and many mothers left destitute. Many of those adopted children, now adults scattered across the globe and trying to trace their origins, have accused agencies of corruption and malpractice, including in some cases forcibly removing them from their mothers. A report released earlier this week by a Korean government commission supports those claims and uncovers new evidence on the coercive methods used to force mothers to give up their children. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, tasked in 2022 with investigating the claims, found that more than a dozen babies in several government-funded care facilities in the 1980s had been forcibly taken to adoption agencies, sometimes “on the day of birth or the next day.” It examined three care facilities in the cities of Daegu and Sejong where, in 1985 and 1986, 20 children in total were transferred to adoption agencies. Most of those children were adopted overseas in the United States, Australia, Norway and Denmark. “The circumstances confirm the facilities forcing mothers to give up their parental rights,” the commission told CNN in a statement, marking a bittersweet victory for adoptees who have sought for decades to hold the government to account. The commission is still investigating cases allegedly involving falsified paperwork. An interim report is expected to publish later this year. More than 200,000 South Korean children have been adopted overseas since the 1950s following World War II and the Korean War, according to authorities. Many of those children were adopted by families in the US and Europe. While adoptions continue today, the trend has been declining since the 2010s after South Korea amended its adoption laws in an effort to address systematic issues and reduce the number of children adopted overseas. For a generation of adoptees who have grown up in often homogenous, majority-White populations, some say they feel both disconnected from their Korean roots and unable to fit in. It’s what prompted a search for their biological families. Some of those adoptees say they have mixed emotions over the commission’s findings, feeling both horror and hope that the investigation will shed light on what many long suspected. “It’s truly terrifying to hear how systemic these issues were, but I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily surprising,” said Susanné Seong-eun Bergsten, who was adopted from South Korea and grew up in Sweden. Bergsten’s biological family found her when she was a young adult, and while there was no sign that her paperwork was falsified, she says she can understand the struggles having been involved in advocacy for Korean adoptees. “Us adoptees, we’re all kind of told, these adoptions are for our own good and we should all feel grateful for escaping poverty,” she said, calling the reality “far more complex.” “Our adoption papers often lack important information which could give us more context for adoption, like our cultural background, stigma, and the individual struggles that our parents faced in the post-war era,” she said. Mark Zastrow, a Korean adoptee who was raised in the US, told CNN the findings were an “important milestone.” “[It] validates what Korean adoptees have known for decades within our community: The narrative that Korean mothers chose of their own volition to relinquish their children is, in all too many cases, a fiction,” he said. While both Zastrow and Bergsten said it marked a promising step in the right direction, Bergsten urged the government to continue taking accountability and offer reparations to adoptees and their families. “Adoption touches every level of Korean society, every economic class,” said Zastrow. “There is still much about Korean adoption that has not been formally acknowledged.”\n",

            "Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, whose complicated and painful legacy included stabilizing the country’s economy before being jailed for human rights violations and corruption scandals, has died at the age of 86. “After a long battle with cancer, our father, Alberto Fujimori, has just departed to meet the Lord. We ask those who loved him to accompany us with a prayer for the eternal rest of his soul,” his daughter Keiko Fujimori said Wednesday night on X. Fujimori, who ruled Peru from 1990 to 2000 during some of the nation’s most divided times, had been fighting for his health, his primary care physician Alejandro Aguinaga said earlier on Wednesday in brief statements to reporters outside the home of Keiko Fujimori. Fujimori had previously revealed he had been diagnosed with a new malignant tumor in May. A deeply divisive figure in his country, Fujimori’s tenure in office brought the country back from the brink of economic collapse, and saw the defeat of a terrorist group that had destabilized the country. But he was also a authoritarian leader who used security forces to crack down on opponents, and was later convicted of serious human rights violations and corruption. The son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori studied at an agricultural university in the Peruvian capital of Lima before traveling overseas for his graduate education in the US and France. Once back in Peru, he hosted a television show focused on environmental issues before launching a presidential bid in 1989 as the leader of a new party – Cambio 90 (“Change 90”) – eventually defeating future Nobel literature prize-winning authorMario Vargas Llosa. His rise saw him join a small number of politicians of Asian descent to lead a non-Asian country. Fujimori inherited a country in economic crisis. Soon after taking office, he implemented austere economic policies known as “the Fujishock,” which reined in hyperinflation. He also claimed victory over theShining Path rebel movement, one of the oldest guerrilla groups in Latin America, after his government captured the group’s leader, Abimael Guzman, who was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. Years later, his handling of a months-long hostage siege by another rebel group at the Japanese ambassador’s residence garnered him international praise. For some Peruvians, Fujimori’s domestic victories transformed him from a political outsider to the strongman the country needed. But the former president had an authoritarian streak, using security forces to repress opponents. Soon, abuse of power and corruption allegations emerged and cast a dark shadow over his national achievements. In the early 90s, Fujimori’s then-wife, Susana Higuchi, publicly denounced him as corrupt andclaimed his family had illegally soldclothing donated to Japan. After the pair divorced, Fujimori installed the couple’seldest daughter Keikoas Peru’s first lady ahead of his second term. In 2000, Fujimori stood for an unprecedented third term in office despite questions about the constitutionality of running yet again. He won, prompting his main opposition candidate to claim election fraud. But his government crumbled spectacularly later that year, after videos ofVladimiro Montesinos– his powerful intelligence chief for over a decade – were leaked, showing Montesinos bribing an opposition congressman. The scandal quickly snowballed as numerous incriminating videos emerged. Fujimori denied any wrongdoing, but his standing with the public began to shift. Many Peruvians were left unconvinced and insisted he must have been aware of his top aide’s abuse of power and embezzlement. That November,during a trip to Japan, Fujimori tried to quit the Peruvian presidency by sending a fax home announcing his resignation. The move threw the country’s political landscape into chaos. Days later, Peru’s congress instead fired him and labeled him “morally unfit” to govern. He remained in Japan for a number of years, defiant that he would one day return to the upper echelons of Peruvian politics. In the mid-2000s, he traveled to Chile while preparing to stage a political comeback but was promptly arrested and eventually extradited back to Peru to face human rights abuse charges, among other alleged violations. Fujimori has been in and out of prison over the last few years as a result of his declining health, after being convictedin four different criminal trials. In 2009, a special supreme court tribunal sentenced him to 25 years in prison for authorizing the operation of a death squad responsible for killing civilians. In separate trials, the former president was also found guilty of breaking into Montesinos’ home to steal incriminating videos, taking money from the government treasury to pay the spy chief and authorizing illegal wiretaps and bribing lawmakers and journalists. He received a medical pardon for his human rights abuses in December 2017 from then-Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. Kuczynski’s office issued a statement at the time, saying Fujimori “suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable disease,” adding “prison conditions mean a serious risk to his life, health and integrity.” “I am aware that what resulted during my administration, on one hand, was well-received but I recognize that on the other hand, I have also disappointed other compatriots. To them, I ask forgiveness from the bottom of my heart,” Fujimori had said in a video filmed from his hospital bed andposted to Twitter in 2017. But the pardonsparked violent protestsin the capital of Lima and attracted widespread criticism from human rights organizations and lawmakers. It was ultimately overturned and in January 2019 he was returned to prison. Separately in 2018,a Peruvian court ruledhe could face trial for allegedly authorizing the 1992 kidnappings, torture and killings of six people in the central Peruvian town of Pativilca, according to state-run news agency Andina. Even with multiple criminal convictions Fujimori always held his ground, arguing that any actions he took were for the good of the country. He maintained that position until the very end.\n",

            "A problematic airline passenger has been hit with an unusual form of punishment – he has to pay back the airline for the cost of fuel. According to the Australian Federal Police, a then-32-year-old man from Western Australia was disruptive on a flight headed from Perth to Sydney. As a result, the plane had to turn around and go back to Perth, which meant that the pilot was forced to dump some fuel to land. Now, the passenger has been ordered to pay $8,630 AUD ($5,806 USD) back to the airline  to cover the cost of the wasted fuel. The Perth Magistrate Court also fined him $6,055, meaning that his mid-air misbehavior has a total price tag of $11,861 – likely many times higher than whatever he spent on the ticket. “This incident should serve as a warning that criminal behavior on board can come at a heavy cost to the offender,” Shona Davis, the AFP’s Acting Superintendent, said in a statement. “It’s far simpler to obey the directions of airline staff than cause unnecessary issues, which can end up hitting you in the hip pocket.” Although the flight happened on September 25, 2023, it has taken about a year for the case against the unruly passenger to work its way through the Australian legal system. Neither the man nor the airline was publicly named, nor was it specified exactly what he did to earn such a hefty penalty. The passenger pleaded guilty to one count of disorderly behavior on an aircraft and one count of failure to comply with safety instructions. While charging a disruptive traveler for the cost of fuel is not a typical penalty, other kinds of fines are more common. In 2021, the US Federal Aviation Administration announced that they would be introducinga zero-tolerance policyfor fliers behaving badly on planes. That year, passengers were issued fines for a range of incidents on planes across the United States, including one passenger who attempted to enter the plane’s cockpit and had to be restrained and another who punched a flight attendant in the face, sending them to the hospital. The most serious cases of in-flight mischief are also reported to the Department of Justice. The single highest individual penalty, $40,823, was issued to a traveler who brought their own alcohol on board, was intoxicated, attempted to smoke marijuana in the lavatory, and sexually assaulted a flight attendant – all in a single flight.\n",

The fuel tanker was also carrying cattle in the Agaie area in north-central Niger state and at least 50 of them were burned alive, Abdullahi Baba-Arab, director-general of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, said. Search and rescue operations were underway at the scene of the accident, Baba-Arab said. Baba-Arab said initially that 30 bodies were found but in a later statement said an additional 18 bodies of victims who were burned to death in the collision were found. He said the dead had been given a mass burial. Mohammed Bago, governor of Niger state, said residents of the affected area should remain calm and asked road users to “always be cautious and abide by road traffic regulations to safeguard lives and property.” With the absence of an efficient railway system to transport cargo, fatal truck accidents are common along most of the major roads in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country. In 2020 alone, there were 1,531 gasoline tanker crashes resulting in 535 fatalities and 1,142 injuries, according to Nigeria’s Federal Road Safety Corps.\n",

            "A runaway penguin has been found safe in Japan nearly two weeks after she first went missing, having paddled 45 kilometers (28 miles) during a typhoon in a survival story her keeper called “miraculous.” The six-year-old Cape penguin, who goes by the name “Pen” and was born and raised in captivity, was swimming with staff from the traveling Gekidan Penters zoo at a beach on central Japan’s Himakajima island on August 25 when she escaped, Pen’s keeper Ryosuke Imai told CNN. While taking a dip in the ocean to avoid heatstroke, Pen suddenly became agitated and swam through a hole in her enclosure out into open waters. Her escape left Imai wracked with worry and guilt. African penguins can swim up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) a day, he said, but in captivity, their muscle mass decreases. Pen had never swum in the sea before visiting that beach. “I couldn’t help but feel despair,” Imai told CNN. “The chances of her surviving in the wild were very low.” A lucky break would keep Pen safe. A powerful typhoon called Shanshan brought high winds and torrential rain to the country at the end of August, killing at least six people, displacing millions, knocking out power and disrupting air travel. But, amid the destruction, the typhoon was a boon for little Pen, Imai said. With no boats able to operate, Pen avoided collisions and getting caught in fishing nets. The record rainfall provided a reliable source of hydration and cooling. “She survived because of the typhoon,” Imai said. “It was almost miraculous timing.” Because of the typhoon, Gekidan Penters wasn’t initially able to send out rescue boats to search for Pen, so it was even more surprising when on Sunday someone spotted her swimming near a beach about 8 miles from where she first went missing. It was just 10 minutes from the facility where she usually lives. “When we first received the report, I couldn’t believe there was really a penguin,” Imai said. “It was a huge relief.” Pen had no injuries and was in good physical shape. She also passed “substantial droppings,” Imai said, which means she must’ve found something to snack on during her journey – likely fish or crab, her keeper guessed, though Pen had never eaten live fish before. As Imai spoke to CNN, he said Pen was “sleeping very comfortably next to me.” He added, “it’s nothing short of a miracle.”\n",

            "Israel has launched multiple strikes on southern Lebanon over the last day, including one which killed a senior Hezbollah commander. Mohammed Qassem Al-Shaer, a commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, was killed in a strike on the village of Qaraoun in the western Beqaa district on Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF said Al-Shaer had “advanced numerous terrorist activities against the state of Israel” and his “elimination” would impair the Iran-backed militant group’s ability to launch attacks against Israel from southern Lebanon. Hezbollah confirmed Al-Shaer had been killed and said it responded to his killing by launching “dozens” of Katyusha rockets and several drones toward two locations in northern Israel. No casualties were reported, according to the IDF, which said some of the “projectiles” were intercepted and others fell in an open area. The IDF said it responded by striking Hezbollah launchers “in the areas of Mansouri and At Tiri,” which had been used in the attacks. On Wednesday, the IDF said it struck overnight 30 Hezbollah launchers and “terrorist infrastructure sites” in areas of southern Lebanon which “posed a threat to Israeli civilians.” Lebanese state media NNA reported multiple Israeli strikes overnight on several areas, some of which caused “extensive damage” to property, crops, and buildings in the town of Al-Qlaileh. In a statement Wednesday, Hezbollah said that another fighter was killed, but did not say where or the cause of death. It also did not mention the strikes. The Israeli military also said Tuesday its air force had struck a Hezbollah military structure in the village of Rachaf in the Nabatieh governorate of southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s emergency service said 12 people were wounded in the strike 12 on Rachaf. The latest strikes come weeks after Israel said it had killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in a drone strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold. Shukr was the most high-ranking Hezbollah official to have been assassinated since 2016,when Mustafa Badreddine, the group’s top commander at the time, was killed in Syria. The hostilities in July raised the specter of a regional conflagration, prompting intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since war broke out between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on October 7. Israeli raids continued in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday with the IDF saying its “aircraft conducted an aerial strike during the counterterrorism operation in Tulkarem.” At least five people were killed in an overnight Israeli airstrike, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, after the Israeli military said Wednesday it carried out operations in the areas of Tammon and Tubas. The IDF said it began the operation with the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) “against terrorist infrastructures,” and an air strike was carried out on “an armed terrorist squad” in the Tubas area, the IDF said. The IDF added in a later statement that an Israeli “aircraft struck and eliminated a terrorist cell consisting of five terrorists armed with explosives who posed a threat to the forces” during its overnight operations in Tubas and Tammon. The governor of Tubas, Ahmad As’ad, told CNN the strike hit a group of “young unarmed Palestinians” around 3 a.m. local time. The group, who were in their teens and twenties, were sitting near a mosque at the time, he said. As’ad also said five people were killed, as did the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Video obtained by CNN showed at least one motionless body near a mosque in Tubas. As’ad said “we were informed by the Palestinian Coordination Office of an Israeli military operation on the city and surrounding areas” before the strike. Israeli forces raided the city and blocked access to the government hospital, he said, adding that there is an Israeli military imposed curfew. “The situation is dangerous,” he said. CNN has reached out to the IDF. The Israeli military has carried out major raids and airstrikes in multiple parts of the West Bank in recent weeks. On August 28, it launched a large counter-terror operation with the ISA in the areas of Jenin, Tulkarem and Tubas in the north of the West Bank, in an offensive Israel said wasits most expansive in years. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that operation had been staged to “thwart Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure,” claiming that Iran was working to establish an “eastern front” against Israel. Israel has stepped up its military operations in the West Bank, where clashes have become more frequent since Israel began its war in Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7. Around 700 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah and the UN, whose figures do not distinguish between militants and civilians.\n",

            "Nearly 200 people have died in Vietnam in the aftermath of Typhoon Yagi and more than 125 are missing as flash floods and landslides take their toll, state media reported Thursday. Vietnam’s VNExpress newspaper reported that 197 people have died and 128 are still missing, while more than 800 have been injured. The death toll spiked earlier in the week as a flash flood swept away the entire hamlet of Lang Nu in northern Vietnam’s Lao Cai province Tuesday. Hundreds of rescue personnel worked tirelessly Wednesday to search for survivors, but as of Thursday morning 53 villagers remained missing, VNExpress reported, while seven more bodies were found, bringing the death toll there to 42. Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit the Southeast Asian country in decades. It made landfall Saturday with winds of up to 149 kph (92 mph). Despite weakening on Sunday, downpours continued and rivers remain dangerously high. The heavy rains also damaged factories in export-focused northern Vietnam’s industrial hubs.\n",

            "Since building a home for herself and her three kids over the past few years, Jennifer Garner has shown glimpses of the sunny farmhouse dwelling through her social media posts. The kitchen’s exposed wood beams and stone fireplace can be seen as she carries her fluffy cat, Moose, to places in the home he’s “never seen before” (inside the refrigerator and microwave, up high to peer at the family aquarium). She showed off her home gym and hillside pool views, too, filming herself as shetrained to reprise the role of Elektra— and also, jokingly, announced that she hadfailed to make the Olympic Games. But until now, Garner hasn’t given a full tour inside her Westside Los Angeles property. That’s all changed with Architectural Digest’s latestcover story, which reveals a cheerful, rustic space designed and constructed from the ground up by Steve and Brooke Giannetti — with help from designer Laura Putnam — who are well-known with design circles for building spacious and light-filled arcadian houses integrated with the natural world. “I wanted (the home) to feel old and cool and historic, but I also wanted to make it work for a big family with a lot of things going on,” Garner told AD for the October issue. She had searched for a home with privacy, but the ones she toured all felt too “grand,” she explained. Instead, she tasked the Giannetti’s with building an entirely new space, which they based on the actor’s memories of her childhood in West Virginia, according to AD. “I had this idea of creating something that felt like a farmhouse and a barn,” Steve said in the cover story. “We wanted natural wood, coziness—a kind of warm embrace of a house for her because she’s such a lovely person.” The home reflects that sense of comfort, with natural materials and a neutral color scheme topped off with antique and repurposed furniture in the living room, brass chandeliers and marble countertops in kitchen, and a nickel soaking tub with views of the greenery outside. “There’s also something a bit whimsical about her,” Brooke added. “And she likes gentle shapes, curves. This place is kind of the house version of Jen’s personality.” There’s plenty of opportunities to connect with nature, too. The kitchen opens up to the tranquil pool and a bucolic fruit and vegetable garden, while floral and arboreal wallpaper appear in the kids’ rooms and bathrooms. It’s a house fully in use, too, rather than siloed off — a rarity for a house with multiple pre-teens and teenagers. “I am happy that I feel like we use the space really well, and that the kids are all over the house,” Garner said. They’re as comfortable sitting in the living room as they are doing homework in the dining room. And that’s the dream, right?” That’s the vision that Garner had, the designers explained — a thoughtful approach to how everyone might use the space once it was built. Perhaps most touching are the stained-glass windows in the study and reading room, inspired by the children’s book “All the World” by Marla Freeze — a cherished book in the family. The windows were made by the author’s son, the artist Reed Bradley, as a tribute to his mother’s work. But he incorporated Garner and her family into the symbolism of the windows, with owls representing each of the kids, as well as an appearance by their dog, Birdie.\n",

            "Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel on Friday was more focused onTua Tagovailoa’swell-being than the team’s future after the star quarterback suffered another scary head injury in Thursday night’s game. Tagovailoa was injured in the third quarter of Thursday’s 31-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills when he dove for a first down and took a hit to the head in a collision with Bills safetyDamar Hamlin. The 26-year-old stayed on the ground at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens and was attended to by Dolphins trainers. Tagovailoa eventually walked off the field under his own power and was replaced by backup quarterback Skylar Thompson. McDaniel told reporters Friday that Tagovailoa was sleeping when he tried to call earlier in the morning and said Tagovailoa would be having his first “after action” meeting with team medical experts later in the day. “It’s important that he gets healthy day by day and in that the actual best thing I can do is not try to assess what this even means from a football standpoint,” McDaniel told reporters on a video conference. It’s at least thethird concussionthe quarterback has suffered during his NFL career.McDaniel refused to speculate about the severity of Tagovailoa’s latest concussion or a timeline for his possible return to the football field. “It didn’t really matter the severity of it,” McDaniel said. “All the science behind concussions tells you what we’ve learned is how delicate the time is right after an injury and how important it is that you don’t institute extra sources of anxiety.” “Questioning timelines – that gives forth anxiety,” McDaniel added. “Trying to meet them, trying to assess what this means for playing – this is heavy stuff. You have to be diligent and deliberate in coaching up Tua. ‘Hey, your job is to be a dad and to communicate daily.’ “We’ll have daily assessments with experts in the field and handle that, and that is the only thing that matters.” McDaniel was also quick to shut down questions about whether Tagovailoa might becontemplating retirement. “I think it would be so wrong of me to even sniff that subject,” McDaniel answered. “You’re talking about his career, right? His career is his.” “The most important person in this whole equation is Tua,” McDaniel said later.“His opinion and what he wants to do with his life and his career coupled with the experts in neuroscience, those are the driving forces behind those actions.” “I’m extremely motivated to do right by the person that we’re talking about,” McDaniel added. “That’s not an ideal way to do business necessarily, but this is more than business.” As for the future of the Dolphins, McDaniel said the team would be moving forward with preparing Thompson to start in Week 3, but added that the team would also be looking to add another quarterback to the roster. “The team and the organization are very confident in Skylar,” McDaniel said. “There was a reason he was our backup quarterback.” The 41-year-old McDaniel was hired by the Dolphins ahead of the 2022 NFL season. He has compiled a 21-15 record and has led Miami to the playoffs the last two seasons. McDaniel has dealt with his fair share of issues while at the helm of the Dolphins including star wide receiver Tyreek Hill being detained by police ahead of the team’s season opener last week. The Dolphins play again on September 22, when the team travels to Seattle to face the Seahawks.\n",

            "An airstrike targeting civilian areas in southeastern Sudan has left more than 20 people dead and dozens of others wounded, authorities in the embattled Sennar state said, as civil war rages between the country’s army and a paramilitary militia. At least 21 civilians were killed and 63 injured in the air raid on Sunday, Sennar’s acting governor Tawfiq Muhammad Ali said Monday,accordingto state-run news agency SUNA. The aerial bombing, blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), was also confirmed by activist group Emergency Lawyers, which keeps track of human rights abuses and civilian casualties. The lawyers’ groupsaidmore than 30 people were killed in the RSF attack, which it said targeted a market and other civilian locations. The RSF, which assumed near-total control of the city after capturing it in July, has yet to comment on the claims. The activist group also attributed a similar airstrike in the nearby al-Souki town that killed four people to the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). CNN has made attempts to reach the Sudanese army and the RSF for comment. Both the SAF and the RSF have frequently accused each other of killing civilians as war between them enters a second year. The conflict has left at least 18,000 people dead and displaced more than 10 million others since April 2023. The fighting has also triggered“one of the worst humanitarian disasters”according to the United Nations, with over half of the country’s populationfacing acute hunger. On Friday, a UN inquiry into the Sudanese conflict found that both warring factions have committed “an appalling range” of human rights abuses that “may amount to war crimes.” Some of those violations by the SAF and RSF included “indiscriminate and direct attacks carried out through airstrikes and shelling against civilians, schools, hospitals, communication networks and vital water and electricity supplies,” according to theUN report. The report called for the deployment of an independent force to protect civilians as well as a nationwide arms embargo. Those recommendations wererejected by the Sudanese foreign ministrywhich denounced the UN report.\n",

            "SEOUL (Reuters)– North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the country is now implementing a nuclear force construction policy to increase the number of nuclear weapons “exponentially,” state media KCNA said on Tuesday. In a speech on North Korea’s founding anniversary on Monday, Kim said the country must more thoroughly prepare its “nuclear capability and its readiness to use it properly at any given time in ensuring the security rights of the state,” said KCNA. A strong military presence is needed to face “the various threats posed by the United States and its followers,” he added. Kim also said North Korea is facing a “grave threat” from what it sees as a US-led nuclear-based military bloc in the region. South Korea’s deputy defense minister for policy, Cho Chang-rae, and his US and Japanese counterparts on Tuesday condemned Pyongyang’s recent diversification of nuclear delivery systems, tests and launches of multiple ballistic missiles. Meeting in Seoul, the three reaffirmed a commitment to strengthen trilateral cooperation to ensure peace in the region, including by deterring North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, according to a joint statement released by the US State Department. They also agreed to hold a second trilateral military exercise known as Freedom Edge in the near term. South Korea will also hold a defence ministerial meeting with the member states of the United Nations Command (UNC) on Tuesday. The UNC is led by the commander of the US military stationed in South Korea. Last month, Germany became the latest to join the UNC in South Korea that helps police the heavily fortified border with North Korea and has committed to defend the South in the event of a war. North Korea has criticised the UNC as an “illegal war organisation” and Germany’s entry into the US-led UN border monitoring force as raising tensions.\n",

            "Playing safe is not an option for wildlife photographer Greg du Toit. The South African has spent the past two decades photographing lions, rhinos and elephants, embracing more adventure and danger than most people will experience in a lifetime. Unlike many in his field, du Toit says he doesn’t use bait, camera traps, digital manipulation, captive bred animals or drones. All he needs is his Nikon camera, a chance to get close to his subject, the right natural light, and a lot of patience. It’s a combination that has won him international accolades, including Wildlife Photographer of the Year in 2013, and in April, the wildlife category at the Fine Art Photography Awards, for “The Enchanted Forest,” a series showing elephants in a forest on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. Speaking with CNN by phone, on the way to Tanzania for his next project, he shared his approach to fine art photography, what the past two decades have taught him and why taking pictures in Africa feels different to anywhere else in the world. The conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What are the most important aspects to you when you’re taking a picture in the wild? Greg du Toit: I learned to photograph on film, so I like my work to resemble a moment that I experienced from behind my camera, sort of a moment in nature. So I never do multiple exposures. The fundamental thing remains the same as it always was since the very first time I picked up a camera, and that is light. I really like to work with beautiful quality light, golden or blue even sometimes. And then beyond that, sort of adding a touch of mood or a touch of mystery. CNN: How do you achieve mood in your pictures? Du Toit: I spend a lot of time in nature. I get up super early, for the good light, I stay up late and then, like for this Enchanted Forest series, I just found places in the forest that work right, where there was a beautiful window or there was a beautiful light coming through, and I just wait for an elephant to show up. So that portfolio, it’s literally five photographs and it took me five years. From a business point of view, that makes absolutely no financial sense whatsoever, but I’m just an artist. For me, it’s all about just creating the art even if it comes at a great expense in terms of investing time. I do just love being out there as well, so it’s not like a major sacrifice. CNN: In the age of social media, I’d expect photographers to be constantly posting series after series instead of really taking their time… Du Toit: I had always focused on only quality. I used to get, like, six photos a year and I’d be happy with that. Then social media came along and especially Instagram, and it was like, ‘no, you need at least an image a day,’ or more than that even, and I just couldn’t do that. I kind of gave up on social media, which sort of felt like I was committing career suicide when I did that. But I’m just sticking to my guns. I can’t sort of adapt and just produce quantity because the way I work just does not allow for that. CNN: What are you hoping to convey with your wildlife photography Du Toit: I just want to tell people that it’s not too late, especially here in Africa. We still have such incredible wildernesses, full of these amazing animals, and that’s why when I photograph, I really try and focus on not just the animal itself, but on the environment in which that animal lives. That winning series of elephants is exactly that.  There are still these incredibly wild places that are still full of incredible animals and it’s not too late for us to enjoy them, to preserve and conserve them. CNN: You mainly focus on taking photographs in Africa. What would you say that makes wildlife photography in Africa different from other parts of the world? Du Toit: I’ve been on trips and the other parts of the world are wonderful. For example, I’ve been up to the Arctic to photograph polar bears, and I’ve been to India for tigers and things like that. But every time I’ve done that, I’ve just felt that those places lacked this energy that Africa has. It’s like a wild energy … there’s that feeling of mystery and intrigue, the feeling that this place is so big and so vast and a little bit dangerous, and I love that. Du Toit famously once spent 16 months photographing lions at a waterhole in Kenya’s South Rift Valley. For the first 13 months he sat in a hole in the ground next to the water hole, followed by three months laying in the water, in an effort to get the perfect shot. CNN: When you took your iconic pictures of the lions, you were there sitting in the water for months, you caught malaria. Is there a kind of contradiction between the beauty of the end product, and the reality of the work that goes into getting the image? Du Toit: Yeah, the photographs you see are just polished and they just look beautiful, but the reality of getting those photographs is very different. Very often in these really wild places in Africa, you get gypsy flies and so you end up being bit by these flies and it’s really painful, so between shots you’re kind of swatting flies. It’s hot and sweaty, so it’s not glamorous work. Also, your cameras get dirty and [Africa] it’s a very sort of dusty place. But I really just love the end product. Getting a good photograph is the sort of best thing I can do. It’s the best feeling, and I really do just love nature. I’d rather be there than anywhere else. CNN: One thing that many people don’t realize is that, apart from the picture of the two lions, there is another one with a bunch of lions just standing there… Du Toit: That’s right, there were others watching me. I sort of unpacked this in my book [“Wilderness Dreaming,” published in 2022], but I’d only thought about getting the shots, I didn’t think beyond that. So when those two lionesses finish drinking, they just lay on the edge watching me and then it started to get dark. So I slowly started trying to move to the side of the waterhole (…) I’m moving, I’m getting to the edge of the water. The water’s getting shallower. So more and more of my body is becoming exposed and these lionesses are getting more and more interested… I’m quite amazed I lived to tell the tale. Eventually I managed to get to the edge of the water hole, and I just jumped up and ran off. CNN : You don’t use camera traps, digital manipulation or captive-bred animals. Why is that important to you? Du Toit: I want to photograph animals in their wild habitats, doing what they naturally do. For me, it’s all about wildlife… It’s all about the subject and the subject’s environment, and then it’s about light, and really using good quality light because that for me is what brings that kind of mystery, and then just working with good angles. I love good backgrounds as well. CNN: Do you have any particular tricks for capturing animals’ natural behaviour without disturbing them? Du Toit: Wild animals know the shape of a human being and I don’t want to scare or intimidate my subjects; I want them to just be doing what they would do naturally. So I’ve learned ways to conceal the human form, and one of the simplest ways is to photograph from a vehicle. I can spend 10, 12 hours a day in a car, so well over 50,000 hours a year in a car. The other thing I do, which I did with the lions, I dug a hole in the ground, so you sit in the hole and then you have a roof over you, and then you photograph from there. CNN: What is your next photography project? Du Toit: I’m trying to create a body of work and then go to Ngorongoro crater [in northeastern Tanzania] because it’s one of those places in Africa that’s glossed over. It’s the most incredible place. It’s an extinct volcano and it’s nature’s own game reserve. It’s kind of like Jurassic Park. I’m going to be spending a week there now, which is fun.\n",

            "An overnight Israeli airstrike on an area that Israel itself had designated asa humanitarian zonefor displaced people in southern Gaza has killed and injured dozens of Palestinians, according to local officials in the besieged enclave. Israel said the operation targetedHamas fightersthere. At least 19 bodies arrived at hospitals from the humanitarian zonein Al-Mawasi, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. More than 60 people were also wounded, it said, as rescuers raced to recover victims buried under sand and debris. “People thought they were asleep safely. Suddenly we woke up to the sounds of explosions, and fires were surrounding us from every side. We didn’t know where the strike hit, where the remains are, or where the blood is. Everything was scattered,” Mahmoud Al Nims, a resident, told CNN. CNN footage from Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis showed men and boys standing in congregation to perform Islamic funeral prayers for the deceased on Tuesday. Mourners carried the dead, including children, in white shrouds as women wailed at the steps of the hospital. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said that it “struck significant Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command-and-control center embedded inside the humanitarian area” in Khan Younis, Gaza – a claim that Hamas denies. According to the IDF, among those targeted were Samer Ismail Khadr Abu Daqqa, whom the IDF says was the head of Hamas’ aerial unit in Gaza; Osama Tabesh, whom was “the head of the observation and targets department in Hamas’ military intelligence headquarters;” and Ayman Mabhouh, whom it said was “another senior Hamas terrorist.” The targets were “directly involved in the execution” of the October 7 attack on Israel and had been planning to “carry out terror activities” against the IDF and Israel, an IDF statement on Tuesday added. CNN is working to independently verify these claims. Hamas has denied it had placed fighters in the area. In a statement, it called Israel’s claims that its fighters were in the area “a blatant lie, through which it (Israel) seeks to justify these heinous crimes.” The strike hit Al-Mawasi, a coastal region in Khan Younis where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled Israel’s bombardment from other parts of Gaza. Many are living in tents in an area with sparse infrastructure, scant access to shelter or life-saving humanitarian aid. The explosion created three large craters, Gaza Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said. The group also said its crews were facing “great difficulty” in retrieving victims – many of whom were believed to have been sleeping at the time of the strikes – due to a lack of resources. Earlier, Gaza’s Civil Defense said40 people had been killed, though the reason for the discrepancy in the two figures was not immediately clear. Human rights agencies have repeatedly criticized Israeli attacks in designated safe zones. On Tuesday, the Norwegian Refugee Council accusedIsraeli forcesof “forcing Palestinians in Gaza to flee from place to place without offering them genuine assurances of safety, proper accommodation or return once hostilities end.” The Israeli military has placednearly 86%of the Gaza Strip under evacuation orders, according to the UN. At least 1.9 million people havebeen displaced The strike was also strongly condemned by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, whose spokesperson Stephane Dujarric described the use of heavy weaponry in densely populated areas like Al-Mawasi as “unconscionable.” Dujarric said that the strike reaffirmed the Secretary General’s warnings that “there is no safe place in Gaza.” “(Israeli forces) told us to go to Mawasi and we did, and they strike us. We have been displaced a hundred times,” Taghreed Abu Assi, a Palestinian in Khan Younis told CNN. The Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel has flattened neighborhoods, wiped out families and created a humanitarian disaster across the enclave. Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed 41,020 Palestinians and injured another 94,925 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN footage from the aftermath of the strike on Al-Mawasi showed dozens of people trying to recover the remains of their belongings. Poles that used to hold up tents protruded from the sand, but the material that covered their inhabitants was buried. Mattresses, blankets and clothes were scattered around another much bigger crater on the other side of the camp. Some survivors pulled canned food from under the sand and a girl with an injured hand watched as those around her attempt to rebuild their tents. “We were sleeping peacefully in our homes when, suddenly, rockets started falling heavily on us,” one survivor, Salem Abu Jara, told CNN. “Why are people being burned here?” Israel’s military said the operation was carried out with the direction of the Israel Security Agency and the Air Force, and that steps were taken to mitigate civilian harm “including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional means.” The military did not say whether it warned civilians in the area. Hamas said “dozens of unarmed civilians, most of whom were children and women” were killed in the strike. Gaza Civil Defense’s Bassal said Palestinians in the area were not warned of the strike in advance. There were more than 200 tents of displaced people at Al-Mawasi area, Bassal said, adding about 20 to 40 tents were destroyed and “entire families have disappeared in the sand.” Two weapons expertstold CNNthe visual evidence from the scene of the assault in Al-Mawasi suggests 2,000-pound bombs were used. “The significant damage and the size of the craters align with the expected effects of aerial bombs weighing several hundred kilograms,” Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), said on Tuesday. CNN footage fromthe aftermathshowed emergency crews wearing bright orange vests and scouring dense, blown-out debris for survivors. Rescue personnel could be seen hauling large pieces of barbed wire and dusty mattresses in the dark. The IDF has accused Hamas and other militant groups in the Gaza Strip of continuing to “systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure, including the designated Humanitarian Area, to carry out terrorist activity against the State of Israel and IDF troops.” Israel has previously struck Al-Mawasi in its pursuit for Hamas commanders and previous strikes have caused significant civilian collateral casualties. In mid-July, a strike aimed atHamas’ military chief Mohammed Deifkilled at least 90 Palestinians. The following month, Israel said its intelligence community had confirmed that Deif, one of the reported masterminds of the October 7 attacks, was killed in that attack. Israel says it has killed or captured half of Hamas’s commanders and more than 14,000 combatants since the war began. However, there are clear signs of the group’s resurgence in parts of the strip previously cleared by Israeli forces, who devastated large swathes of the area in the process.\n",

            "Olga is running around the intensive care unit, constantly checking her patients’ oxygen levels, adjusting their medication and noting their vitals. She’s working fast, but even at her busiest, the nurse anesthetist doesn’t hesitate to pause to adjust a pillow or blanket, and make sure the injured soldiers in her care are as comfortable as possible amid the constant rocking and rumbling. A sergeant in theUkrainian military, she is attending to some of its sickest patients. It’s a busy job – and she is doing it on a speeding train. CNN gained exclusive access to a medical evacuation train used by the Ukrainian army to transport the wounded from near the frontlines to hospitals around this large country. This infirmary on wheels – one of several crisscrossing the nation – is now a key part of Ukraine’s healthcare system, which has been highly depleted by two and half years of Russia’s brutal war. It is operating in complete secrecy, which is why CNN is not revealing its route or identifying its staff by their full names. Most cities ineastern Ukraineare struggling to find enough hospital beds to accommodate the almost constant stream of casualties from the frontlines. But freeing up space requires that even the sickest patients, many of them unconscious, are transferred to far-flung places, often hundreds of miles away. Long ambulance journeys are too risky for people in a critical condition, and flying a helicopter is too dangerous given Russia’s air superiority over Ukrainian skies. The train is a lifesaver. “We can do almost everything here. It’s a fully-fledged intensive care unit,” Oleksandr, who is a captain of the Ukrainian Medical Forces and the train’s chief resident, told CNN. He explained that his field – combat medicine – mostly involves stabilizing and evacuating patients to safety, rather than carrying out treatment. His work on the train is just one part of a medical chain that starts the moment a soldier is wounded. “The most difficult part is evacuation from the frontline,” he said. “Combat medics who work on the front are dying just like soldiers.” Running an ICU unit on a moving train is a herculean task that involves dozens of people and presents a unique set of challenges. Oleksandr said the vast majority of his patients, some 90%, have suffered multiple shrapnel injuries. Many have had amputations, and several are intubated, alive thanks to ventilators and other life-support machines. All have numbers written on their hands showing which car of the long evacuation train they need to travel on. “We are very limited in our capabilities here… If something happens, I cannot call an outside consultant,” he said. “There may be minor operations, to stop bleeding. We cannot perform abdominal… and chest surgeries. We have to be very careful when selecting the patients,” he added. Yevgeniy was severely wounded in a drone attack just two days before he was selected for evacuation on the ICU unit of the train. He suffered multiple shrapnel injuries. His head was bandaged and two huge scars on his chest and stomach were covered with fresh dressings. Breathing with the aid of an oxygen nasal cannula, Yevgeniy told CNN he was the lucky one, as the only survivor from the attack nearBakhmut in eastern Ukraine. He said he wasn’t going to tell his family about his injuries until he was feeling better. The railway hospital is an example of the kind of Ukrainian ingenuity that impressed the world in the early months of this conflict. Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, the CEO of passenger operations at Ukrainian Railways, told CNN that Ukraine did not have any medical railcars when Russia launched its full-scale invasion on the country in February 2022. “So what we saw is that the wounded soldiers were physically just forced through the windows (of regular trains). And we said something has to be done about that… and started retrofitting our regular railcars that in peaceful days would just bring tourists to the Carpathian Mountains,” he told CNN after overseeing the arrival of one of the medical trains. To limit rocking, the vehicle travels at about 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour, which is about half the speed of a regular train. It also has priority over everyone else – including any special VIP trains carrying foreign dignitaries. Even so, the ICU unit is constantly shaking. Every piece of equipment, every bed and every beeping machine needs to be anchored to the floor and the staff must take extra care when working on the patients. Ambulance trains were first used during the Crimean War in the 1850s, but they have come a long way since then. The modern Ukrainian versions come equipped with ventilators, life support machines, ultrasound scanners and portable air conditioners that help maintain stable temperatures even on the hottest days. Each carriage is a self-sustained unit powered by generators – an important safety feature given the frequent Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Pertsovskyi said. But it is the little touches that make these trains truly special. Children’s drawings and Ukrainian flags are on display in every car, offering some comfort to the bruised and battered passengers. The blind brackets on every window are shaped as a trident, the country’s national symbol, placed deliberately in the eyeline of soldiers lying in their beds. The train provides a small window into the brutal cost of war. Experienced warriors and new recruits are traveling together, united by injury and pain. Sitting quietly on his bed Oleksandr looked tired even before the long journey began. He told CNN he was hurt in a Russian drone strike. “They dropped a grenade. I was stunned. I have shrapnel in my hands, on my shoulders and on my back,” he said, adding that the blast wave damaged his hearing. An electrician and a father of two, the 35-year-old was mobilized 18 months ago and was serving as an anti-tank gunner in an infantry battalion in the Donetsk region. In all that time, he has spent just 45 days away from the frontlines. “Morale is high, but people are very tired,” he said with a blank stare, as the train kept chugging along. “At this point you realize that everything depends not on you, but on God. Or on luck. When the bombs fall, there is not much you can do about it.” It was a sobering assessment from a man with the callsign “Positive.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has long admitted that the military is struggling to replenish its ranks, leaving exhausted soldiers without a chance to rest. At a news conference last month, Zelensky said this effort to recruit more soldiers was gathering steam. “Some rotations have started. I can’t call it fundamental rotations yet, to be honest. But it’s a start, and that’s very important,” he said. The fatigue is affecting frontline morale.CNN recently spokewith multiple Ukrainian commanders and officers who said desertion and insubordination is becoming a growing problem, especially among new recruits. Sitting just a few beds away from Oleksandr was Stanislav, who enlisted voluntarily just three months ago. He was also wounded by a drone that dropped into his trench, leaving him with a punctured lung, broken ribs and other injuries. Yet Stanislav appeared in a completely different state of mind to Oleksandr. “After I was wounded, my spirits didn’t dim. I got more motivated,” he told CNN with a smile. Wearing a sports jersey and shorts, he was adamant Ukraine would win the war, despite being outnumbered and outgunned by Russia. “They use quantity, and we use quality,” he said. Nearly nine hours into its journey, the hospital train finally pulled into a railway station in one of Ukraine’s cities. In the darkness of the night, a long line of ambulances was awaiting the patients. The train’s voyage was over, but their road to recovery was only starting. Some will likely never fully recover. Olga, the ICU nurse, was getting ready to hand her patients over to the medics on the platform. Her job was done for the day. She joined the military as a civilian nurse in 2015, a year after the conflict between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine started in the eastern parts of the country, and Crimea was illegally annexed by the Kremlin. She enlisted in the military in 2016 and – except for a short break in 2022 – has served ever since. After her shift ended, she told CNN that seeing critically ill patients coming from the frontlines is the toughest part of her job. “But we have the opportunity to provide much-needed help to our defenders 24/7, and that’s the best part.” When the ambulances departed and the train left the station, Pertsovskyi, the railway chief, was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. The medical train is thought to be a major target for Moscow and there have recently been several strikes targeting the vicinity of railway stations and other infrastructure. Standing on the platform, just hours after he saw a train full of new recruits headed in the opposite direction, he reflected on the brutality of the conflict. “In the morning, I see these kids who are saying goodbye to their dads who are heading towards the frontlines,” he said. “So, seeing those same guys coming back… unconscious or with amputations, it feels like the price of the war is incredible. It’s a conveyor belt.”\n",

            "Hundreds of posters have appeared on billboards across Italy this summer, bearing the slogan: “Russia is not our enemy” and depicting a handshake in the colors of the Italian and Russian flags. Some, including those that appeared inRomethis week, also feature the words, “Enough money for weapons for Ukraine and Israel. We want peace. We reject war.” The posters, which first appeared in northern Italy in June and have been seen in Verona, Modena, Parma, Pisa and several cities in the southern region of Calabria, were paid for by associations that were formed to protest the country’s Covid-19 lockdowns, according to Sovranita Popolare, the group organizing the billboard campaign in Rome. Ukraine’s embassy in Rome was unhappy about the development. “We are deeply concerned by the arrogance of Russian propaganda in the Eternal City,” itposted on X, adding: “We ask @comuneroma to reconsider granting permits for such posters that have a clear purpose of rehabilitating the image of the aggressor state.” Official reaction to the posters has varied from region to region. In some places, the posters were removed by local officials, while in others they have been allowed to remain until the expiry of their payment. In Rome, the posters drew ire from the mayor’s office because they featured both the city’s name and its official symbol. In a decree to local police and the advertising company that owns the billboards in Rome, it ordered the removal of all posters. The advertising company, Nuovi Spazi Advertising Srl, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Despite the order to remove the posters, on Friday afternoon there was still one on Piazza Mazzini, one of the city’s busiest traffic circles, in a well-heeled residential area. On Friday, Sovranita Popolare posted a lengthy article on itswebsite, taking responsibility for the campaign and quotingArticle 11 of the Italian constitution, which reads: “Italy rejects war as an instrument of aggression against the freedom of other peoples and as a means for the settlement of international disputes. “Italy agrees, on conditions of equality with other States, to the limitations of sovereignty that may be necessary to a world order ensuring peace and justice among the Nations. Italy promotes and encourages international organisations furthering such ends,” the constitution continues. The group, which sent CNN the article in response to a request for comment, claims that since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “politicians, leaders, parties, government supported by the allied and accomplice press, slowly and by turning to Italian citizens, have configured fear, the enemy close to invading Europe.” It goes on to say, “For two years, Italian warmongers have been fueling Russophobia, a feeling of hatred towards Russian people, culture and art.” Officially, the Italian government under Giorgia Meloni backs the country’s continued military support to Ukraine, under a resolution agreed by the European Union. Meloni and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, have met several times in Rome. Earlier this month, they met at the European House’s Ambrosetti Forum in Cernobbio, northern Italy. But several members of Meloni’s ruling coalition have privately shown sympathy for Russia, including the late former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi – whoseclose friendshipwith Russian President Vladimir Putin was well documented – and her deputy prime minister and transport minister, Matteo Salvini, who was famously photographed wearing a Putin T-shirt in Moscow’s Red Square, before the war began. Asurveycarried out in May for the European Council of Foreign Relations think tank showed that the majority of those polled in Italy, along with Greece and Bulgaria, opposed increasing aid to Ukraine. The Russian propaganda posters have not caused notable outcry among the Italian public, in part because they started appearing during the summer months, when most Italians take their vacations. Most of the comments on the Ukrainian embassy’s post on X argue that Italy should not be subject to censorship, and that free speech should be allowed. Italian law does not require the content of posters to be approved by cities or regions, but companies that own the advertising space are expected to follow rules that forbid the support of fascism or other extreme views, a spokesperson from Italy’s main media governing body told CNN.\n",

            "German police shot dead an armed man after a terror attack near the Israeli consulate in central Munich on Thursday, officers said, prompting an investigation by state prosecutors. The suspect – an 18-year-old Austrian citizen – was armed with an older rifle with a mounted bayonet when he was shot on Karolinenplatz, a square near the Israeli consulate and a Nazi documentation center, according to police in Munich. The suspect was fatally injured after shots were exchanged, Munich police said in a post on X. Five officers were involved in the shootout, according to Andreas Franken, a police spokesperson. At least 500 personnel were called to the scene in Munich’s city center, Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said. A helicopter was deployed to provide a more detailed assessment of the incident, according to Reuters. There is no indication other suspects may be involved, police added. Authorities assume the attack was planned, Herrmann told reporters on Tuesday. The teenager had parked a car near the scene of the shooting. One unnamed eyewitness told German media that he heard several bullets fired, before police shot the suspect to the ground. “I heard several shots and, as a member of a shooting club, I knew immediately that they were firing,” the 65-year-old man told Bild newspaper. “It took several minutes for the first police officers to come up behind him. They then shot him at least 30 to 40 times. After that, I just heard them shouting: ‘He’s lying on the ground, he’s not moving.’” The suspect may have been influenced by religious extremism, the Bavarian attorney general’s office said on Tuesday, after launching an investigation into the shooting. “There are indications that the perpetrator was known in the Islamist environment. The investigation is ongoing, so nothing concrete can be said at this stage,” chief public prosecutor Florian Weinzierl, said on Thursday. Officials will investigate whether other people knew about the crime. The suspect was already known to police in February 2023, after making a dangerous threat against pupils and causing bodily harm, according to the Austrian police department in Salzburg. He was also accused of participating in a terrorist organization, and was active online. The teenager was also interested in explosives and weapons, the police department added. In April 2023, the Salzburg public prosecutor’s office dropped all charges, following an investigation. Authorities confirmed a weapons ban against the then 17-year-old, which was scheduled to remain in place until at least the beginning of 2028. He had not been reported to officers since then, the police department added. The incident took place on the anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympics terror attack – when a Palestinian militant group entered the quarters of Israel’s national team. Eleven Israeli athletes were killed in the ensuing standoff. It is not clear if Thursday’s incident is at connected to the 1972 event, but the Israeli consulate nearby was closed for a commemoration. Bavarian Minister President Markus Soeder cautioned there is a “terrible suspicion” that the shooting was linked to the anniversary, but said more clarification was needed to determine the motive. “The protection of Jewish institutions is of central importance to us,” he said in a press conference on Tuesday. “The motives and backgrounds of the perpetrators will certainly have to be determined in the coming hours, but one thing is clear, there is a serious suspicion, because today is the anniversary of the attack in Munich in 1972, there may be a connection.” On Facebook, Talya Lador-Fresher, the Israeli consul general in Munich said, “We are very grateful to the police in Munich for their actions and cooperation. This event shows how dangerous the rise of Antisemitism is. It is important that the general public speaks against this. Our Consulate General was closed today to commemorate 52 years since the terrorist attack at the Olympics.” Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the terror attack on Thursday. “Let me be clear: anti-Semitism and Islamism have no place in our country,” he said in a post on X. “The quick reaction of the emergency services in Munich today may have prevented something terrible from happening. I am very grateful to them for that.” The incident came on the heels of a divisive round of regional electionsin Germany– after the Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the first far-right party to win a state election in the country since the Nazi era, on Sunday.

            "Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba became the latest top official to tender his resignation on Wednesday, ahead of a major government reshuffle, as yet another wave of Russian attacks overnight killed at least seven people, including a child. As Ukraine’s top diplomat, Kuleba has been a prominent fixture in Zelensky’s administration and one of the most public-facing, especially dealing with overseas officials. He was seen as a capable politician and a safe pair of hands, one of the strongest members of Zelensky’s cabinet. His offer to resign comes ahead of an expected visit by the president to the United States this month. Kuleba’s was the latest in a flurry of resignations. Two of Ukraine’s vice premiers, three ministers, the head of the State Property Fund and a top official in Zelensky’s Presidential Office have all quit within the last day or so. The parliament approved Kuleba’s resignation on Thursday and Andrii Sybiha was sworn in as foreign minister to replace him. Sybiha has previously served as ambassador to Turkey and deputy head of the presidential office. The resignations of the three other ministers and one of the vice premiers were approved on Wednesday. Zelensky has not yet given any explanation for the reshuffle, but said in his nightly address on Tuesday that the coming fall will be “extremely important for Ukraine” and as such “our state institutions must be set up so that Ukraine achieves all the results we need.” Kuleba and others who tendered their resignations are widely expected to be appointed into other roles in the Zelensky administration. The reshuffle comes at a precarious time for Ukraine. Its troops are under increasing pressure on the eastern frontlines, especially around the strategic city of Pokrovsk that is on the brink of falling to Russia. It seems likely that Zelensky wants to have his new team in place for his trip to the US later this month, where he is expected to attend the United Nation General Assembly and meet the US President Joe Biden. Zelensky said last week that he intends to present Biden with a new four-part “victory plan” – without providing details. The last major change Zelensky made to the top echelon of Ukraine’s leadership came in February, when he replaced the former Commander in Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi with Oleksander Syrskyi. Zaluzhnyi currently serves as Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. Ukrainian political scientist Mykola Davydiuk said there were no major disagreements within the government. Instead, Zelensky is likely trying to send a signal that he is injecting new energy into his government. “(The president’s office) wanted to do this last fall, then in December, then in May. They spoke about it so they need to do something, otherwise people will not believe them,” he said, adding that Zelensky likely sensed a window of opportunity for the reshuffle. “The West can’t criticize him now because they have a lot of domestic issues to deal with – the US election, election trouble in Germany and France,” he added. Davyd Arakhamia, the majority leader of Ukraine’s parliament, said Tuesday that there would be major changes expected in the cabinet this week. “As promised, a major government reset can be expected this week. More than 50% of the Cabinet of Ministers’ staff will be changed,” Arakhamia said on Telegram, adding that new members would be appointed imminently. Among those who have resigned was the Minister for Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin, who was in charge of weapons production. He is expected to assume another defense role, Reuters reported. The resignations also include the justice, environment and reintegration ministers. “To do this, we need to strengthen some areas of the government… I am also counting on a slightly different weight for certain areas of our foreign and domestic policy,” Arakhamia said. Speaking to CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour Tuesday, Kuleba saidhe expectsPutin to continue increasing air attacks on Ukraine before winter sets in. “Putin still has the same purpose to freeze people, to destroy our economy and this is his strategy. So I’m afraid he will continue with his barrage of missile and drone attacks over the course of the autumn,” he said. The attacks, Kuleba said, are “just another reason why delivery of air defense systems to Ukraine must be expedited.” The expected reshuffle came as Russian missiles continued to rain down on Ukrainian cities. Just a day after two ballistic missiles hit an educational facility in Poltava in central Ukraine,a major attack struck Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that has long been considered a safe haven in the war-torn country. Lviv’s mayor Andriy Sadovyi said seven people, including a 14-year-old girl, were killed and 25 were injured in the attacks. A 15-month-old child suffered “moderate” injuries and four other children have minor injuries, according to the head of the city’s regional military administration Maksym Kozytskyi. Lviv, in Ukraine’s far west, is generally far away from Russian borders, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach it – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down. Many people from eastern regions relocated there to seek safety. Kozytskyi said that at least seven “architectural monuments of local importance,” including houses located in a historic part of the city and inside a UNESCO buffer zone, were also damaged in the attack. On Tuesday, a Russian strikeagainst a military educational facilityin central Ukraine killed 54 people and injured nearly 300 others, according to the state emergency service of Ukraine. It was one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ukraine’s Air Force said Wednesday it shot down 22 attack drones and seven cruise missiles. At the same time, Ukraine is still reeling from a massive wave of attacks against the energy infrastructure last week. Power cuts are still impacting lives across Ukraine, with millions suffering from power cuts every day. At least five people were killed and more than 10 wounded in Russian attacks in the central city of Kryvyi Rih after a hotel building was destroyed, according to the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration Serhiy Lysak. The strike on Kryvyi Rih appears to be part of a wave of Russian attacks targeting hotels. Facilities in Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia, and another one in Kryvyi Rih were all hit by strikes in the past week or so. Speaking about the attacks, Zelensky again appealed for Kyiv’s allies to supply Ukraine with more air defenses and to lift restrictions on the use of western weapons on targets in Russia. Meanwhile, the chief of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in occupied southern Ukraine on Wednesday. Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that the situation at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe was “very fragile.” The Ukrainian energy company Energoatom said one of two power supply lines to the plant was damaged on Monday following Russian strikes in the region. “Today we have one of the two existing power lines down, which means that the station is again on the verge of being on a blackout,” Grossi told reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday, before heading to Zaporizhzhia. Explaining why a power cut could cause a serious accident at the plant, Grossi said: “Blackout, no power… No power, no cooling… No cooling, maybe you have a disaster.” This story has been updated.\n",

            "Pope Francis received a rapturous welcome from the tiny Southeast Asian nation of East Timor, one of the world’s most Catholic countries, where almost half the population turned out for an open-air Mass on Tuesday. The 87-year-old leader’s visit marks the penultimate stop of a marathon trip through Asia and the South Pacific. Local authorities estimate that a crowd of 600,000 gathered for the pope’s Mass, the Vatican told reporters. By early Tuesday morning, streets in the capital Dili were packed with cheering crowds, from elderly worshippers to babies in strollers, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pope. Photos showed a sea of people carrying yellow and white umbrellas, the colors of the Vatican, as they tried to shield themselves from the sun, and at one point a man was seen hosing down the crowd with water to cool them down. Some attendees had been waiting in the seaside park where the mass took place since 4 a.m. - more than 12 hours before the event began. Estefania Clotaria-Monterio Gutierrez Ornai, 25, was among them, keen to secure a place in the front row. “I hope that through his visit here, he can show us to be more respectful to each other and encourage us that, one day, one of us could become the pope like him!” she told CNN. On arriving at the park to shouts of “Viva Papa Francesco,” people with physical disabilities lined up to meet the pontiff, and a group performed a traditional, cultural dance for him. During the Mass prayers were also said in local dialects. At the conclusion of the Mass, the pope addressed the crowd in Spanish with a priest translating into Timorese. Francis drew laughs and cheers when he referenced crocodiles: there are large numbers of crocodiles in the sea around East Timor, and traditional belief holds that reptiles represent people’s ancestors. “Be careful,” the pope told them. “I was told that crocodiles are coming to some beaches. Crocodiles that come swimming and have a stronger bite than we can handle. Be attentive to those crocodiles that want to change your culture, your history. And stay away from those crocodiles because they bite, and they bite a lot.” During his homily, he also praised East Timor for the large number of children in the country, which he said was a “great gift.” It is not the first time Francis has addressed birthrates in this trip: in Indonesia he praised the country for having large familiesand contrasted that with low birthrates in other parts of the world. After the Mass concluded, the Timorese singer, Maria Vitória da Costa Borges – known as “Marvi” – performed on stage.  A onetime winner of Portugal’s “The Voice,” she performed alongside another Timorese singer, known as Bepi. But the issue of clerical sexual abuse is also hanging over this leg of the pope’s visit to the region as revelations of mistreatment concerning high profile East Timor clergy have emerged in recent years. During his speech to the country’s political authorities, the pope called on them to tackle “every kind of abuse” to “guarantee a healthy and peaceful childhood for all young people.” East Timor, also known as Timor Leste, is one of the world’s youngest countries and has deep ties to the Catholic Church, which was influential in its tumultuous and bloody fight for independence from Indonesia. The country of just 1.3 million people is the second-most Catholic country in the world, with 97% of the population identifying as Catholic, the highest share outside of the Vatican. The government of East Timorallocated $12 millionfor Francis’ first visit to the deeply devout country, an amount which has been criticized as an exorbitant burden given it remains a small economy and one of Asia’s poorest nations. The pontiff’s visit also puts fresh scrutiny on the scourge of sexual abuse in the church and on whether Francis will directly address the issue while he’s in East Timor, as he has done in other countries. Two years ago, the Vatican acknowledged that it had secretly disciplined East Timor bishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner Carlos Ximenes Belo, after he was accused ofsexually abusing boys decadesbefore. In past trips abroad, Francis has met with victims of abuse. Though not on the official program of his visit, some analysts have said if Pope Francis addresses the abuse while in East Timor, it would send a strong message to survivors and those who have not come forward, whether in the country or around the region. Pope Francis’ 12-day visit to Asia includes Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore – underscoring a significant shift inside the Catholic Church as it pivots to Asia. He is the second pope to visit East Timor, after Pope John Paul II in 1989, but it’s the first papal visit for the country since it gained independence in 2002. The visit comes less than a week after the country marked the 25th anniversary of its vote to secede from Indonesia. Located between northwestern Australia and Indonesia, the country occupies half of the island of Timor and was used by the Portuguese since the 17th century as a trading post for sandalwood. Four hundred years of ensuing Portuguese colonial rule led to the widespread spread of Catholicism in East Timor and other cultural differences from Muslim-majority Indonesia. Today, East Timor’s economy is heavily reliant on its oil and gas reserves, and still contends with high levels of poverty following decades of conflict. Christina Kheng, a theologian who teaches at the East Asian Pastoral Institute, told CNN that the young nation “is still struggling with post-war unity and nation building.” Like other countries in the region, East Timor is in the middle of the United States and China’s push for influence in Asia, with US ally Australia at the forefront in providing assistance. A leading pro-democracy figure during the Indonesian occupation was Bishop Belo, the former head of the Catholic Church in East Timor, who won the Nobel Peace Prize alongside President Jose Ramos-Horta in 1996 for their work in bringing a peaceful end to the conflict. In 2022, the Vatican confirmed that it had sanctioned Belo two years prior, following allegations from two men who said the bishop raped them when they were teenagers and gave them money to buy their silence. The Vatican said that Belo, who is understood to be based in Portugal, had been placed under travel restrictions, “prohibition of voluntary contact with minors, of interviews and contacts with Timor Leste.” While the allegations against Belo date back to the 1980, the Vatican said it first became involved in the case in 2019. CNN has asked the Vatican if the case of Bishop Belo will be addressed during the pope’s trip. Dutch newspaper De Groene Amsterdammer broke the news and said its investigation found that other boys were also allegedly victims of Belo’s abuse dating back to the 1980s. Belo has never been officially charged in East Timor and has never spoken publicly about the accusations. Many abuse victims in East Timor have been reluctant to come forward due to the church’s deep connection to the independence struggle, and because of the government’s treatment of the few who have been convicted. Since Pope Francis became the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics in 2013, multiple reports detailing decades of sexual abuse, systemic failures and cover-ups across multiple countries have been released. While he was criticized for some of his actions – such as when he defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up a sex scandal in 2018, a decision he later described as a “grave error” – he has since taken a firm stance on the issues and introduced some reforms, including provisions for holding lay leaders of Vatican-approved associations accountable for cover-ups of sexual abuse. Amid civil war, East Timor was annexed by Indonesia in 1976 and declared the country’s 27th province following Portugal’s democratization and its decision to shed its colonies the year before. Between 1975 and 1999, more than 200,000 people – about a quarter of the population – were killed in fighting and massacres or died as a result of famine as Indonesia’s occupying forces tried to brutally assert control. Indonesia was condemned by the international community for its crackdown, including in 1991 when its troops massacred young independence supporters at the Santa Cruz cemetery in East Timor’s capital Dili. The capture and jailing of Timorese guerilla leader and now Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao the following year further fanned a resurgence in opposition to Indonesian rule. It was Indonesian President Suharto’s fall from power in 1998 and an ensuing shift in policy toward East Timor that paved the way for a UN-sponsored referendum on East Timor’s independence – which passed with more than 78.5% support in 1999. Soon after the vote, pro-Jakarta militias backed by the Indonesian military went on a killing and looting rampage in the capital, attacking churches, and targeting priests and those seeking refuge as they hunted down independence supporters. Much of East Timor’s infrastructure was destroyed in the violence and about 200,000 people were forced to flee their homes. An Australian-led international peacekeeping mission ultimately intervened and East Timor officially won independence in 2002. During Indonesian occupation, the Catholic Church played a huge role in defending people from attacks and pushing for a vote on independence – its church workers and the clergy paying a bloody price as a result.\n",

            "To the untrained eye, a tennis court is merely an amalgamation of nine parallel and perpendicular lines, converging to define the limitations of movement for both ball and player. But to American photographer and journalist Nick Pachelli, a tennis court is the harmonious union of surface, sound, and spectators, complemented by the natural elements and the inherent intensity of tennis. “Tennis is our only sport where the canvas on which we play can change so dramatically,” Pachelli, a former top junior tennis player himself, told CNN, highlighting each court’s “unique persona,” as he describes in his new photobook, The Tennis Court. During more than 500 days of travel, Pachelli visited over a thousand courts (of the roughly 200 in the book), crisscrossing more than 250 cities and towns in his pursuit of spotlighting the world’s most aesthetic, esteemed, and even idiosyncratic tennis courts. From cliffside clay courts pocketed between the peaks of the Swiss Alps, to the salsa capital of the world that is Cali, Colombia and the vibrant purple and green hardcourts of Yangpyeong, South Korea where the background noise isn’t the cheers and gasps of crowds, but a DJ creating a partylike atmosphere. The result was not only an anthology of captivating, vivid visuals and evocative essays, but also, essentially, a love letter to the sport and an homage to its patrons and communities. “The book constantly asked this question of, what do we think about when we think about tennis?” said Pachelli, “We take that question as the spectator, the newcomer to the game, the die-hard player, the professional, the groundskeeper; every single role you could think of around this sport.” Pachelli’s inclusive approach challenges historical preconceptions of elitism and inaccessibility which have long blemished tennis. In Pachelli’s view, tennis institutions must reckon with this convoluted history in order to advance the sport and elevate its global community. Pachelli gives the example of Lawn Tennis Clube da Foz in Porto, Portugal and the Junior Tennis Champions Center in Maryland as bastions of preserving tennis’ prestige while simultaneously uplifting their local communities through initiatives such as waiving fees for low-income youths, empowering female coaches and curating programs for disabled players. The expansiveness of Pachelli’s journey is also a reflection of tennis’ surging popularity. In 2023, the ATP (the worldwide top-tier tennis tour for men organized by the Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (the principal organizing body of women’s professional tennis) tours recorded more than 1.84 billion in combined global audiences, while the United States Tennis Association marked four consecutive years of participation growth with nearly 24 million Americans playing the sport. Pachelli partially credits local grassroot initiatives with this surge, and also notes Hollywood’s recent investment in tennis with films such as King Richard and Challengers. “There’s so much exciting grassroots tennis happening,” said Pachelli, “There are young tennis communities emerging that are finding their own tennis sensibility.” Yet despite his extensive travels, Pachelli still finds his peace cushioned between the seats of Grandstand and Court 17 in Flushing Meadows, New York, watching US Open games with some friends and some food, to a serene sunset backdrop. “There’s no energy like the US Open. It’s wild and congested and a little drunk,” Pachelli said. “There’s no other place in the world like the US Open to experience every type of viewing of professional tennis.” “I hope that sort of global tennis community interconnectedness is what will hopefully inspire some people to go experience it in new places,” said Pachelli, “because I think that’s the ultimate way to learn about yourself, see the world, and engage with your fellow tennis obsessives somewhere else.”\n",

            "Ahead of a keyUS presidential debatethis week, families of several American hostages held in Gaza are calling on US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to offer new ideas for securing the immediate release of their loved ones. “We want to hear that they care. We want to hear that both candidates understand and acknowledge there are seven Americans still in captivity, and that the US is fully committed to bringing them back,” Ronen Neutra, a US-Israeli dual citizen from New York, told CNN. His 22-year-old son, Omer, is a serving Israeli soldier and was abducted by Hamas during the October 7 attacks. CNN spoke with relatives of three US citizens held in Gaza who all expressed frustration that attempts to free their family members over the past 11 months had so far failed. “Enough is enough,” said Adi Alexander, whose 20-year-old son Edan was serving in the Israeli military when he was abducted by Hamas on October 7. “Perhaps the deal proposed by President (Joe) Biden back in December was good then, but maybe we need something different now,” he added. All the family members who spoke to CNN said they were looking to the Biden administration as well as Trump and Harris to find creative ways to increase pressure on Hamas and Israel to reach a new deal. “I would challenge the candidates and ask them, you know, how to get our kids back,” said Ruby Chen, another US-Israeli citizen whose 19-year-old son, Itay, was killed during the attacks last year. His body is still being held by Hamas in Gaza. “We want to hear new ideas from both candidates and for them to commit to adopting a fresh approach to all the players,” Chen told CNN. The family members told CNN that approach should include the US seeking new pressure points on Hamas and its sponsor Iran, as well as on other nations with potential influence, like Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, the Gulf state which hosts Hamas officials and has helped facilitate negotiations. Incentives, such as trade deals, sanctions relief and international prisoner swaps should also be evaluated, the hostage families told CNN, similar torecent dealsagreed between Washington and Moscow to free US citizens such as Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and US basketball star Brittney Griner “They showed great creativity in a complex deal they did for Evan Gershkovich and working an international deal with Germany and other countries to bring American citizens back home,” Alexander told CNN. “Our children may be not as famous as a basketball player, but you know, from our perspective, the creativity they have shown has to come back again here in our case, and to do everything possible, everything within their means – whether it’s putting more pressure, whether it’s finding creative ways to bring our kids back home.” There is even support among the relatives of the US hostages for Washington to apply greater pressure on Israel, whose veteran prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, is accused by critics of thwarting US-led hostage negotiations to appease hardliners in his fragile coalition. The relatives said they would now support moves to curb US diplomatic, financial and military aid to Israel as a way of pushing Netanyahu toward a deal. “Without a doubt, more pressure on Bibi Netanyahu should be placed, but I’m not sure there is political will at this point, either from the Biden administration or the Trump campaign, to put more light between them and the Israeli prime minister,” Ronen Neutra told CNN, using a popular nickname for Netanyahu. “But we are urging our leaders to take brave action and to put politics aside. We are not playing here. This is a real life-and-death situation,” he added. Over 100 hostages remain in Gaza today, as living conditions in the Palestinian enclave crumble under Israeli forces’ months-long siege. Freed hostages have described suffering from frequent shortages of food and water in Gaza, and some have also reported physical and mental abuse by their captors. The recovery earlier this month ofsix murdered hostages’ bodiesprompted mass protests in Israel, with demonstrators demanding Netanyahu’s government strike a deal to free those who remained in captivity. Many wondered if the nationwide outrage might be enough to force his hand. Instead, a defiant Netanyahu has doubled down on his strategy in the strip, stressing his commitment to fighting until Hamas is defeated and repeating his refusal to withdraw soldiers from the border between Gaza and Egypt – a significant new sticking point in talks to reach a deal.\n",

            "Elon Musk has stepped up online attacks on a Supreme Court judge threatening to suspend social media platform X in Brazil, calling him “an evil dictator” in an ongoing feud between the two men. Justice Alexandre de Moraes had threatened to suspend X if Musk did not appoint a new legal representative of the company in Brazil and settle any outstanding daily fines within 24 hours. “Alexandre de Moraes is an evil dictator cosplaying as a judge,” the world’s richest personwrote on X. Musk, who had previously called de Moraes “Darth Vader,” retweeteda statementfrom X’s Global Government Affairs team saying it would publish the judge’s “illegal demands and all related court filings” in the coming days. Brazil is a major market for social media platforms. About 40 million Brazilians, or about 18% of the population, access X at least once per month, according to the Associated Press. The trash talking marks the latest salvo in Musk’s feud with de Moraes, which centers on arguments over free speech and alleged disinformation. X announced earlier this month that it would close its operations and fire its staff in Brazil due to what it called “censorship orders” from the judge. De Moraes had ordered the social media company to block several X accounts he said were spreading disinformation. The latest statement, which was signed by de Moraes, was also shared on the Supreme Court’s official X account, tagging both Musk and X’s Global Government Affairs account. The statement from the Supreme Court was posted at around 8.30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, giving Musk until Thursday evening local time to respond. On August 17, X published a lengthy statement saying it would be forced to close operations and fire staff in Brazil due to de Moraes’ “censorship orders.” “Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process,” the X statement said. “As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately. The X service remains available to the people of Brazil. We are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision. The responsibility lies solely with Alexandre de Moraes.” Later that day, Musk reiterated the official X statement, saying his company had “no choice” but to close Brazilian operations. “Due to demands by ‘Justice’ Alexandre [de Moraes] in Brazil that would require us to break (in secret) Brazilian, Argentinian, American and international law, X has no choice but to close our local operations in Brazil,” he said in an X post.\n",

            "http status: 200\n",
            "The last captive orca in all of Latin America cuts a lonely figure. “Kshamenk” has lived in the Mundo Marino oceanarium in the Argentine city of San Clemente del Tuyú since 1992 – the majority of that time, following the death of his female companion in 2000, as the lone representative of his species. But in recent weeks, Kshamenk has amassed something of a following. One far beyond what might usually be expected at his oceanarium some 320 kilometers (200 miles) from Buenos Aires. A campaign by the Canadian activist group UrgentSeas – which has been working to secure Kshamenk’s release – is building steam thanks to a series of clips on social media that allegedly show the orca in his tank, barely moving. One of the group’slatest postsshows a timelapse video of what it says is a bird’s eye view of Mundo Marino in August and has the hashtag “FreeKshamenk.” It has already amassed more than 184,000 responses on TikTok. Mundo Marino claims the images posted by UrgentSeas “have been maliciously manipulated as part of a disinformation campaign to suggest that Kshamenk is inactive and to make a negative diagnosis about his health, without any objective veterinary indicators.” UrgentSeas insists its “videos are not edited or deceptive. They’re a real time look at Kshamenk’s cruel captivity without the music and spectacle of the show.” “We strongly believe socially complex animals like orcas don’t belong in captivity. Solitary confinement is the highest form of torture and Kshamenk doesn’t deserve that,” the group told CNN. Activists say the videos simply draw attention to the negative side of keeping these apex predators in captivity – a practice that not only in Latin America, but across the world has gone out of fashion in recent decades as the public’s awareness of animal rights issues has grown. Globally, according to the International Marine Mammal Project, as of January 2024 there were just 54 orcas remaining in captivity out of the 166 that have been taken from the wild since 1961. In Kshamenk’s case, controversy over his captivity has been brewing ever since he arrived at the oceanarium more than three decades ago. According to Mundo Marino, “Kshamenk was rescued in November 1992 after stranding with a group of orcas.” But animal rights activists have long questioned that account, alleging that he was deliberately captured to be used in its orca show and have launched legal action against Mundo Marino. “They went out to look for a male orca for Belén, who was the female they had. What they wanted was reproduction to have more orcas and to have an orca show. That is the plain truth,” said María Rosa Golía, from the NGO Marine Animal Rights. Last October several activist groups, including Marine Animal Rights, filed an injunction in court aimed at stopping the orca shows and forcing Mundo Marino to return Kshamenk to the wild. Mundo Marino insists it is acting in Kshamenk’s best interests and that Kshamenk’s remaining years are best spent in captivity. It says that after the orca’s rehabilitation it received expert advice that reintroducing him to the wild would put his life at risk. But some activists are skeptical about that claim and argue that, whatever the truth about his capture, three decades is too long for an animal of Kshamenk’s size – according to Mundo Marino, he is 19 foot long and weighs 4 tons – to be kept in captivity. “Kshamenk has been locked up in that oceanarium, entertaining people (ever since his capture),” said animal rights lawyer Mauricio Trigo. “And since the year 2000, he has not seen another orca,” added activist Dalila Lewis. Other activists point out that, while Kshamenk has spent most of his 35 years of life so far in captivity, he has the potential to live many more if given the right environment. Orcas can live up to 90 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Kshamenk has served Mundo Marino well,” UrgentSeas told CNN. “Now it’s time for them to return some dignity to his life. He doesn’t have to die alone in a concrete tank. The people of Argentina want better for him.”\n",

            "The US city of Milwaukee is already home to theworld’s tallest timber tower. But another, even taller, wooden skyscraper could be added to its skyline, designed by Vancouver-based studio Michael Green Architects (MGA). The firm recently released plans for the development, which includes a 55-story tower made principally from mass timber — thick, compressed, multilayered panels of solid wood. If built, it would usurp the current world title holder, the 25-story Ascent tower by Korb + Associates Architects, as well as becoming the tallest building in the state of Wisconsin. MGA, which specializes in wooden architecture, hopes that the project will set a “new global benchmark for mass timber construction.” The project is part of the redevelopment of the Marcus Performing Arts Center, which opened in 1969 and won the Honor Award for Excellence in Architectural Design from the American Institute of Architects in 1970. Led byNeutral, which bills itself as a “regenerative development company,” the redesign will transform what is currently the center’s concrete parking lot into a space with residential units, offices, restaurants, cafes, grocery stores and public plazas. According to MGA, construction will cost an estimated $700 million. The plan is currently going through the city’s approval process, during which it is expected to evolve. While the use of mass timber is steadily increasing worldwide, thanks to changes in building regulations and shifting attitudes towards the material, it has yet to match the sheer height of buildings made of concrete and steel — although aslew of timber high-riseshave been proposed in recent years. MGA says its tower design would be approximately 600 feet (182 meters) tall — more than double the 284 feet (87 meter) tall Ascent tower. “The race for height is important,” said Michael Green, an architect and founder of MGA. “It’s not about showing off, it’s about showing what’s possible to the public.” He argued that the reason timber skyscrapers haven’t yet become mainstream is because climate change hasn’t been at the center of the conversation. “We didn’t really need to challenge the status quo of steel and concrete,” he said. “But because those materials are so hard on the climate, we had to find a different way to build towers and big buildings in general.” Currently, the building and construction sector accounts for37% of global emissions, much of it down to the production and use of materials such asconcrete and steel, which are massive carbon emitters. Trees are the opposite, absorbing carbon throughout their lifetime. If those trees are turned into mass timber and used for construction, that carbon is “locked in,” or sequestered for however long the building stands. “By building with it, we’re actually building with a carbon sink,” Green argued. But he admits that sourcing enough sustainable timber at the scale needed to build our cities could be a challenge. Indeed, somestudieswarn that increased demand for mass timber could increase pressures on land use. To deliver its purported carbon savings, trees must be grown for a significant length of time to sequester carbon and be replanted once they are cut down. Green said that MGA uses wood from responsibly managed forests in North America. Long term, he believes that to counter supply issues, architects will have to think beyond wood, adding that MGA is currently working on creating other plant-based construction materials. However, he contends, if we want to ease off concrete and steel, mass timber “is the best option for today.” Other barriers to using mass timber have been both cost and strict building regulations. But in recent years, this has changed, explained Green, with mass timber now cost competitive with concrete and steel in many regions. “There are more manufacturers available than we had before: now we’ve got a big competitive market and it’s still growing,” he said. Building codes have also evolved, withsome countries in Europemandating the use of wood construction as part of their climate objectives. In the US, the International Building Codeupdated its policyon mass timber in 2021, allowing mass timber buildings of above six stories. The city of Milwaukee has been particularly forward-thinking, said Green, encouraging development within the city center while also being willing to experiment with new materials. The proposed tower will still use concrete foundations and steel components to make up the elevator cores, but he estimates wood will make up about 90% of the building material. “It is America’s second-scale cities that are breaking new ground on innovations that will help manage climate change,” he said. His hope is that the Milwaukee tower will help to push innovation in climate-friendly architecture, and open people’s imaginations to building with timber. “We need breakthrough moments, and this is a breakthrough moment,” Green said.\n",

            "An Israeli intelligence commander, who critics say played a pivotal role in failing to prevent the October 7 attacks, is resigning, Israel’s military told CNN. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Brigadier General Yossi Sariel, who led its 8200 intelligence unit, has informed them he will “conclude his role in the near future.” The country’s public broadcaster Kan and several other media outlets have published excerpts of his resignation letter stating he feels personally responsible for not preventing Hamas from launching the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. “On October 7th at 06:29 I did not fulfill the task as I expected of myself, those at my command and commanders expected me and the citizens of the state I love so much,” the letter said. “Today, in accordance with the state of the war, the processes of the gathering ranks and the building of the unit’s resilience, and after the completion of the initial investigative processes, I request to fulfill my personal responsibility as the commander of the unit on October 7 and at a time to be determined by my commanders to pass the baton to the next shift,” it continued. Shortly after the attack,a number of top defense and security officials came forwardto take responsibility, to some extent, for missteps that led to Hamas’ attack on Israel, which left 1,200 people dead and another 250 taken hostage. On October 16, the head of Israel’s domesticsecurity agency, Shin Bet, tasked with combating terrorism, wrote a statement saying: “The responsibility is on me.” “Despite a series of actions we carried out, we weren’t able to create a sufficient warning that would allow the attack to be thwarted,” Shin Bet chief Ronan Bar said. Later that month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also received sharp public criticism after he accused security chiefs in a later-deleted social media post of failing to warn him about the impending attack. In a May interview with Dr. Phil McGraw on the “Dr. Phil Primetime” show, Netanyahu admitted there were political and military failures. “The government’s first responsibility is to protect the people. That’s the ultimate enveloping responsibility. People weren’t protected. We have to admit that,” Netanyahu told Dr. Phil. When asked if he held himself to that standard and failed in some way he added, “I hold myself and everyone on this. I think we have to examine how it happened. What was the intelligence failure?” This story has been updated with additional details.\n",

            "Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez landed in Madrid on Sunday afternoon, Spain said, after fleeing his home country withan arrest warrantaccusing him of terrorism, conspiracy and other crimes related to July’s disputed presidential election. Gonzalez, his wife and Spanish officials landed at the Torrejon de Ardoz military air base, according to a statement from Spain’s Foreign Ministry. He is now seeking asylum in Spain, CNN understands. Gonzalez said Sunday his departure from the country came despite “coercion and threats” that he would not be allowed to leave – though he did not make explicit who had made those threats. In an audio note shared with CNN en Español by his press team, Gonzalez said he trusts that “very soon, we will continue the fight for freedom and democracy in Venezuela,” and thanked his followers for their messages of solidarity. He said later that he had decided to leave “thinking of Venezuela and that our destiny as a country cannot, should not be, one of a conflict of pain and suffering.” He also thanked the Spanish government for granting him protection and called for continued political dialogue within Venezuela. Venezuela’s Attorney General Tarek William Saab told CNN on Sunday that authorities will close the case against Gonzalez after his departure. “We, along with Edmundo Gonzalez’s lawyer in the upcoming days will establish the form, time and place to judicially close that case,” he said. Venezuela has been in a state of crisis since the poll, in which authoritarian incumbent Nicolas Maduro wasdeclared the winnerby the country’s electoral authority – a body stacked with his allies – with 51% of the vote. But tens of thousands of tallies published by the opposition showed a convincing win for Gonzalez. Venezuela’s opposition and multiple Latin American leaders refused to recognize Maduro’s victory, which sparkeddeadly protestsduring which thousands were arrested. In a statement on Sunday, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Gonzalez’s departure was “the direct result of the anti-democratic measures.” “The election results and the will of the people cannot be merely swept aside by Maduro and the Venezuelan electoral authorities. We stand with González Urrutia in his call to continue the struggle for liberty and the restoration of democracy in Venezuela,” Blinken said. A day earlier, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said in a statement that Gonzalez “has left the country and requested political asylum” from Spain. She added that Gonzalez had been staying at Spain’s embassy in the capital Caracas, as a “voluntary refugee,” and that Venezuela allowed him to leave “for the sake of the tranquility and political peace of the country.” Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Gonzalez was “at his own request” flying to Spain on a Spanish Air Force plane. “The government of Spain is committed to the political rights and physical integrity of all Venezuelans,” he wrote on X. The minister’s office would not give further details on how long Gonzalez had been in the Spanish embassy. However, the foreign ministry of the Netherlands said Sunday that prior to his stay in the Spanish Embassy, Gonzalez had spent weeks in the Dutch embassy in Caracas, moving in a day after the July 28 election and staying there until early September. “At (Gonzalez’s) urgent request, the day after the elections, I decided to give him hospitality at the state residence of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Caracas for as long as necessary,” the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs Caspar Veldkamp said in a statement. Veldkamp said that in early September, Gonzalez announced his intention to leave both the Dutch embassy and Venezuela “to continue his fight from Spain.” The EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said Gonzalez was at the “residence of the Netherlands in Caracas” until September 5. The Dutch foreign minister said he stressed to Gonzalez the “importance of the opposition’s work and the transition to democracy” but “despite everything, he expressed his desire to leave and continue his fight from Spain.” Gonzalez’s lawyer Jose Vicente Haro has previously told CNN his client had not sought refuge in an embassy. However, he told CNNE on Sunday that due to his client’s need “to defend his life and personal safety” Gonzalez had taken “different decisions from what he had originally wished for.” Haro said the decision to leave Venezuela was reached only late on Friday evening and followed “privileged and confidential information” about potential danger to his life. The lawyer said Gonzalez only had two options: “prison unjustly for crimes he didn’t commit” or “preserve his life” and abandon the country. Asked why Gonzalez chose Spain, Haro said he “assumes” it’s because one of Gonzalez’s daughters lives there. His daughter was seen Sunday outside the Torrejon de Ardoz military air base in Madrid, after Gonzalez and his wife arrived on a Spanish military plane. The lawyer said the situation outside Argentina’s embassy wasn’t a major factor in Gonzalez’s decision to seek asylum, but it was something Gonzalez considered. On Friday, Venezuelan security forcessurroundedthe Argentine embassy in Caracas after two opposition members took refuge inside, joining four others who took refuge there earlier this year. “Many aspects were taken into account, if we had a siege situation in the Argentine embassy, we could have a situation in any embassy accredited in Venezuela,” Haro said. The Organization of American States (OAS) said Sunday that Gonzalez had effectively been “forced into exile” after anarrest warrantwas issued by Venezuela Prosecutor’s Office last Monday. The Prosecutor’s Office had accused him of “crimes associated with terrorism” in relation to the disputed election and said he had failed to respond to three summons regarding its investigation into an opposition website that posted results from thecontested vote. When asked about the “coercion and threats” that Gonzalez said led to his decision to request asylum in Spain, Venezuela’s Attorney General said on Sunday that the pressure and threats came from opposition leader María Corina Machado. “Gonzalez was the victim of pressure from his party that forced him to make decisions,” he said. “There is an absolute fracture in that extremist opposition.” CNN has reached out to Machado for comment. Though the Venezuelan government says it “allowed” Gonzalez to leave, it has not explained why it granted safe passage to a citizen wanted by the justice system, other than saying it was for the sake of political peace. The Maduro government has granted similar safe passages to opposition leaders in the past, with critics accusing it of silencing the opposition through enforced absence. The OAS said Gonzalez “only did what was required” by the Venezuelan government’s actions. “The (Maduro) regime has not only failed to produce the slightest evidence of an electoral result but has forced into exile the candidate Edmundo Gonzalez,” the OAS said in a statement. The United States has pressured the Venezuelan government to release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s claimed victory. It has alsoseized one of Maduro’s planes,saying it was bought in violation of US sanctions. Opposition figure Juan Pablo Guanipa posted on his X account that, though Gonzalez had left, the opposition must continue “fighting” to ensure that their claimed election win is respected. “The important thing is that he was elected, that his election was proven and that popular sovereignty must be respected,” he said.\n",

            "An Israeli official has floated the possibility of offering Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar safe passage out of Gaza, once all remaininghostages held in the Palestinian territoryare released. Israel’s coordinator for hostages and the missing, Gal Hirsch, told CNN’s Jessica Dean on Sunday that if all remaining 101 hostages are returned, “I even believe that we will agree to build safe passage to the chief terrorist, the new Hitler, Sinwar – safe passage to him and whoever he wants to join him out of Gaza.” Hirsch said those conditions, along with Gaza being “demilitarized and deradicalized,” could help recover Gaza and end the war. On Tuesday, Hirsch elaborated on the idea in an interview withBloomberg, saying Israel has already proposed safe passage to Sinwar. “I’m ready to provide safe passage to Sinwar, his family, whoever wants to join him,” he told Bloomberg. “We want the hostages back. We want demilitarization, de-radicalization of course — a new system that will manage Gaza.” He told Bloomberg that the offer of safe passage was put on the table a day and a half ago, but did not say what the response was. Israel would be open to releasing prisoners it holds as part of any deal, he told Bloomberg. CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment on Hirsch’s proposal, and has contacted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office for comment. On Wednesday, a diplomat briefed on ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel told CNN that there’s no indication that Sinwar wants to leave Gaza and that a potential safe passage out of the territory is not a priority for him. Sinwar believes he’s safer in Gaza than he would be in other countries like Iran or Lebanon, the diplomat said. Sinwar, one of Hamas’ most powerful figures, is accused by Israel of being the key architect of theOctober 7 massacrein Israel, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostages. He is also among the Hamas leaders charged by US prosecutors over the deadly attack. Hamas announcedSinwaras the head of its political bureau last month, days after former political bureau head and top negotiator Ismail Haniyeh wasassassinatedin Tehran. He is believed to remain at large in the vast warren of tunnels trenched beneath Gaza, moving frequently and possibly surrounded by hostages as human shields, US officials believe. He has not been seen in public since October 7.\n",

            "New US men’s national team coach Mauricio Pochettino said on Fridaythat his aim is nothing short of competingwith – and beating – the best teams in the world. Arguably the highest-profile hire in the history of US soccer,the formerChelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain manager told CNN Sport that he “can feel the potential of the team,” stating that the side “need to think big” to be capable of competing “with the best teams in the world and to have the possibility to win.” Off the back of the sacking of Gregg Berhalter, who failed to advance the USA out of the group stage of the Copa America tournament held on home soil in June and July, there had been a protracted process to get the deal with Pochettino over the line. Finally, the 52-year-old Argentine was announced this past Tuesday, just minutes before the men’s national team labored to an uninspiring 1-1 draw in a friendly match against New Zealand in Cincinnati. Pochettino’s new charges have now failed to win their past four matches, a fact surely not lost on a head coach universally known as Poch, even if he wasn’t watching from inside the stadium. The opening goal on Tuesday was scored by Christian Pulisic (his 31st international strike placed him fifth on the USMNT all-time list), who is perhaps the lone world class player on the squad. The captain did not hold back in his frustration after the game. “There’s a lot of things that need to change and just the mentality and the culture of the group,” the 25-year-old Pulisic said in his post-match interview. “I think we have the quality, but I know, hopefully, that that’s the first thing that he’s going to want to change.” When Pulisic’s words were put to Pochettino, the new USMNT head coach was empathetic in his response, saying he understood the captain’s disappointment and that “he needs to feel happy.” But as he explained to CNN World Sport’s Don Riddell after giving a news conference at CNN’s Hudson Yards location in New York, Pochettino believes that “the culture is there, the culture of the country is there. Everything has a very good mentality.” If anything, his emphasis was on another word beginning with ‘C’: Compete. “In the last two games, the team play but not compete,” Pochettino said. “That is the key: We need to compete better. We have very talented players, but they need to understand we need to compete better, in the way we want to play and to apply our ideas.” The Argentine will officially take charge for the upcoming friendlies on October 12 in Austin against Panama, followed by an away game against bitter rivals Mexico three days later. But the end game for him and his staff, the players, and a public craving the same sort of success seen with the women’s national team, is in the biggest tournament in global soccer: Leading the team into the 2026 World Cup on home soil, in a five-week festival of football being co-hosted by Canada and Mexico. “It’s massive, one of the biggest events in the world,” said Pochettino, who represented his country of Argentina as a player in the 2002 World Cup, which was co-hosted by South Korea and Japan. “To be involved is a dream come true … and of course we are so excited, not only to improve the team, and to arrive in the best condition, but also to be involved in an amazing event that is going to be the World Cup here.” Despite the next tournament being hosted by the United States, Europe may well provide the key to glory. Many of the USMNT’s most pivotal players – the likes of Pulisic, as well as Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Antonee Robinson, Tyler Adams, Timothy Weah, Giovanni Reyna and Folarin Balogun – all play across the continent in the world’s most prestigious leagues. Indeed, this may well account for the new head coach telling CNN Sport that when it comes to his home base for this role, “we are going to be in between Europe and the USA.” Pochettino himself has a highly impressive resume from his time in Europe. He began in the dugout with Espanyol in Spain’s La Liga before moving to the English Premier League, helping Southampton punch above their weight and then took Tottenham Hotspur to their first UEFA Champions League final, which Spurs lost to Liverpool in 2019. While he didn’t reach the showpiece game with Paris Saint-Germain, his team of megastars (Lionel Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappé) did land the Ligue 1 title, and multiple cups. Pochettino’s most recent stint back in the Premier League with Chelsea was brief, but European football was secured before Pochettino and the club parted ways. The Chelsea factor has proved prescient. The recent hiring of U.S. Women’s National Team head coach Emma Hayes was a coup for the USWNT, as the Blues legend won no fewer than 16 trophies in her 12-year stint with the Chelsea’s women’s team. Hayes has already led her new side to Olympic glory, with the USWNT capturing gold at the recent Paris Olympics. Pochettino is positively gushing in his praise of the USWNT program – a “huge inspiration for me” – and Hayes, with the two having known each other for some time, going so far as to describe Hayes as “the best coach in the world,” and that “for us (the USMNT) it’s a challenge to match them.” While coming anywhere close to the U.S. women’s haul of four World Cups is unlikely to ever come to fruition for Pochettino and the men’s side, a deep run at the 2026 World Cup is going to be high on the agenda for everyone associated with US soccer. But does the new hire read anything into being unveiled on Friday 13th, a date many people are superstitious about? Lucky for some, with a big laugh and smile, the Argentine confirms that “I signed the contract a few days before, the presentation is today, but I signed before (September 10). For people that are superstitious, please, no problem!”\n"
